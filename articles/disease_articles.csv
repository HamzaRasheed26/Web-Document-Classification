Diseases/ Symptoms,8 Signs and Symptoms of Hypothyroidism,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/8-signs-and-symptoms-of-hypothyroidism/,"Also known as underactive thyroid, hypothyroidism is a major condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough crucial hormones. There are differentsigns and symptoms of hypothyroidismto notify, in order to get a quality medical response faster. Hypothyroidism might not always offer noticeable symptoms at the early stages, but with time, untreated hypothyroidism will cause serious health issues like infertility, joint pain, obesity, and heart issues. So, proper thyroid tests are essential to perform once you have covered the basicsigns of hypothyroidism. It helps in diagnosing the issue and getting quality results accordingly. Treatment with synthetic thyroid hormone is a pretty simple, effective, and safe one, once you have coveredthyroid infection symptomsquickly and your doctor came across the right dose to use. Searching the vast world of the internet will not just let you learn about thehypothyroidism effectsbut also provides some surprisingsigns and symptoms of hypothyroidism. It is vital to learn about the 8 surprising symptoms of hypothyroidism so that you can get medical attention faster. One of the majorsigns of hypothyroidism, depression will offer mental instability that you want to avoid from the get-go. It is true that hypothyroidism causes the brain to slow down a bit. So, that makes it difficult for the patients to focus, resulting in clinical depression. Most people underestimate the depression level caused by hypothyroidism these days. Whenever you compromise your mood, you will start feeling stiff and weak. These are some of the basicthyroid infection symptomsto watch out for. Unexpected weight gain is another one of the probablehypothyroidism effectson your body. The low-thyroid individuals are signaling their muscles, liver, and even fat tissues to hold onto calories. Whenever your thyroid levels are low, the metabolism will switch modes. So, in place of burning calories for activity and growth, the basal metabolic rate will start to decrease. Therefore, the body starts to store more calories from diet much like fat. Gaining weight seems to be a pretty obvious sign due to such conditions. Even though hypothyroidism can cause some serious issues with memory jogging, some research and scientific notes have proved that it won’t lead to any permanent cognitive dysfunction. So, even though you might face some memory problems, it is only for a limited time span. With proper medications from doctors, you can ward off your memory problems with ease. While looking forsigns and symptoms of hypothyroidism, feeling cold seems to be at the top of the list. Heat is mainly the byproduct of burning calories. As your body isn’t burning enough calories during hypothyroidism, you will always feel cold. With hypothyroidism, your BMR is going to decrease, and that reduces the amount of heat that you get to generate. Along with that, the thyroid hormone turns up the thermostat on brown fat that generates more heat. Such brown heat is mandatory for maintaining heat during cold climates. But, hypothyroidism will prevent such fat from doing its job. Lower thyroid hormones will flip the metabolic switch towards that of catabolism. That’s when the body starts to break down the tissues like muscles for energy. During this catabolism period, muscle strength starts to decrease, leading to weakness. This process of breaking down the muscle tissue will cause aching. So, aching in muscles and joints will be another one of the majorsigns of hypothyroidismto follow. Even though everyone feels weak at least once, hypothyroidism people are likely to feel it twice! Much like most cells, the hair follicles are promisingly regulated by none other than the thyroid hormone. As these follicles are noted to have stem cells with a shorter lifespan and higher turnover round, they are likely to be more sensitive to lower thyroid levels than any other tissue. The lower thyroid will cause these follicles to stop regenerating and that gives rise to hair loss. It can be improved when you can treat the thyroid problem from its core. So, if you are suffering from unwanted hair loss, it is one of the majorthyroid infection symptomsto consider. Recent studies have shown that around 25 to 30% of patients, who are suffering from hair loss, were proven to be suffering from hypothyroidism. Skin cells are further characterized by rapid turnover, much like hair follicles. So, they are pretty sensitive to losing the growth signals from that thyroid hormone. If the normal skin renewal cycle gets broken, it takes more time for the skin to re-grow. So, the outer skin layer has been accumulating damage for a long time. The dead skin, at this time, will take a longer time to shed, resulting in dry skin. Some studies have shown that around 74% of low thyroid patients are suffering from a flaky skin condition.

Diseases/ Symptoms,Is The COVID-19 Third Booster Dose Really Safe?,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/is-the-covid-19-third-booster-dose-really-safe/,"It has been found that several countries are experiencing a reappearance of Covid-19 driven mainly by thedelta variant of SARS-COV-2. Thus, these countries are in view of the administration of athird booster doseof Covid-19 for addressing the potential fading immunity with time & reduced efficacy against delta variant. A Covid booster dose is an added dose of vaccine given to all individuals after the protection given by the original shot starts declining with time. Thethird vaccine doseindeed helps people in sustaining strong protection from stark coronavirus disease. There is a question that looms large on the minds of the people about the safety of the Covid 19third dose.It is effective in giving protection to people of all age groups that are 5 years and above and severity can be prevented even if a person gets infected with the coronavirus. The number of hospitalization cases has also gone down with thethird booster doseshot. When you get vaccinated with thethird vaccine doseof the Covid-19 vaccine, you will experience similar symptoms to the ones that you experienced after getting a flu vaccine. Symptoms that are common very common include: The above symptoms do not mean that you are sick. It is an indication that your immune system is responding to the vaccine & is building up a guard against Covid-19. There is a big confusion in the mind of the people taking thethird dosewhether they need to take the booster dose of the same brand as the original dose. Recently, the chief authority has approved a mix and match of brands. Suppose you have taken the original dose of one brand, when it comes to the booster dose, you can take another brand dose. It will not cause any harm and the immunity will be increased to a great extent. When it comes to taking thethird vaccine dose,stay assured that it will not have any health issues and is safe to take. It is best to take the booster dose and give a boost to the immunity level that is on the verge of waning after taking the original shots. When an individual completes the vaccination series, protection against the virus starts decreasing with time. Thus, the booster dose is administered to give a boost to immunity. People with comorbidity are highly recommended to take the booster dose. Not only comorbid people but people of all ages above 5 years are recommended to take the booster dose after the original dose. Athird vaccine dosefor Covid-19 is recommended for people vaccinated already and has a weak immune system. According to the research that receiving a booster dose decrease the infection risk & severe illness from Covid-19. People with moderate and severe debilitated immune systems are highly recommended to get athird booster doseshot of Covid-19. A single booster shot is recommended for people above 5 years after they have taken the initial two doses of covid-19. The booster dose not only boosts the immune system but is a responsible act of the people to protect the family as well as the people surrounding them. Pregnant women can also take the booster dose and no side effects have been found so far. Omicronis another variant that is detected globally and to fight this variant, athird booster doseshot has been found to be immensely effective. The emergence of the omicron is a reminder to people globally that people must be careful enough and must practice all covid-19 protocols and should not neglect to take the booster dose. The only way people can fight the pandemic is by wearing a mask and by taking the booster dose. There is no dearth of vaccine availability across the globe. Thus, people should take the vaccine at the earliest if they have crossed the time period after taking the initial doses. Thethird booster doseshot is recommended take after 8months after taking the second dose of Covid-19. It is necessary if any individual wants to achieve protective immunity. People who have received two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine are recommended to go for the booster dose. Thus, the unvaccinated population is at high risk of catching the infection as new variants emerge due to mutation. The most asked question among people across the globe is how safe is thethird dose.The booster shot has been found to be absolutely safe and effective. In a recent study by a reputed vaccine manufacturer of Covid-19, it has been published that nearly 10,000 participants took part in a booster trial where half were given a booster and half were given a placebo. As far as safety is concerned, the researchers did not find any adverse effects. It means the result was consistent & with what was found in previous studies. Thus, it can be said that it is completely safe. For people concerned with pericarditis or myocarditis, inflammation of the outer lining of the heart, nothing was observed. In fact, it was found that the group received the placebo had a more serious effect than the booster group. The booster shot is not only safe & effective for theimmunocompromisedbut for the population at large. It has shown immensely effective in boosting the immunity of an individual tocovid-19. If a person had covid-19 & is completely vaccinated, then also the person needs to take the booster dose. The booster dose is found to be protective for that population and also is not at all harmful. The blend of prior Covid-19 infection & receiving the vaccine looks extremely powerful against reinfection with the virus SARS-CoV2. As already mentioned an individual can take the booster dose right after 8 months from the secondcovid dose.Booster is an added protection for people of all age groups above 5 years. Thus, schedule your booster vaccination in the nearest centre from where you received the initial twodoses. When it comes to taking the booster dose, you must not panic about the dose. The same dose as the first and second dose is given to people across the globe. There is no change in dose. A booster dose gives increased protection to an individual. It has been found that all the vaccines that are given for Covid-19 across the globe are completely safe and the efficacy rate is 95%. This dose is required by all and sundry for getting maximum protection. For an individual who got infected with covid 19, there is 99% less chance of reinfection after receiving the booster dose.

Diseases/ Symptoms,What is the Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Test?,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/what-is-the-thyroid-stimulating-hormone-test/,"Although you have the same habits, your weight has changed significantly; you always feel tired. You are always hot or cold but never comfortable. You did not have a regular period, but you are not pregnant, you have a bump on your neck. If you experience any of these symptoms, it may be time for you to be checked with aThyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) test. TheTSH testis a blood test that measures the level of TSH in your blood. The pituitary gland in your brain makes a hormone calledthyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which stimulates the production of TSH by the pituitary gland. This hormone tells the thyroid gland whether to speed up or slow down its production of T3 and T4. TSH is released into the bloodstream, where it travels throughout your body, stimulating the growth and activity of thyroid cells in your thyroid gland. When too little thyroid hormone is in your body, your pituitary gland will produce more TSH. Conversely, if too much thyroid hormone is present in your body, your pituitary gland will produce less TSH. A TSH test measures how well your pituitary gland works by measuring how much TSH it releases into your bloodstream. The primary purpose of this test is to help diagnose certain conditions such as: It may be beneficial for you to undergo this test if you have symptoms of thyroid disorders, such as weight changes, fatigue, feeling hot all the time (even if others around you are feeling cold), dry skin, hair loss, irregular periods, depression, and anxiety, constipation, and hoarseness. These symptoms are not always caused by an underactive or overactive thyroid gland, so other tests may be needed before any treatment can be started. TheThyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) testmeasures the level of this hormone in the blood. TSH is released by the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain. The pituitary gland produces TSH in response to signals from the hypothalamus and the thyroid gland. The hypothalamus is a small structure in the brain that plays a vital role in regulating body temperature, hunger, thirst, and emotions such as fear and anger. It also sends hormones to the pituitary gland to stimulate or inhibit its production of TSH. The thyroid gland produces two hormones: T3 and T4 (thyroxine). These hormones are essential for normal development in children’s normal metabolism, growth, and development. If you have low levels of T4 or T3 in your blood, this could mean that your thyroid isn’t working correctly. This test aims to find out if you have abnormal levels of these hormones; your doctor will want to check your TSH levels regularly to ensure they don’t get too high or low. Taking certain medications like levothyroxine (Levothroid), methimazole (Tapazole), and propylthiour also affect how well your pituitary gland functions. Before having this blood test, tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking because some medications may affect the test results. Also, tell your health care provider if you have an iodine allergy or have ever had a reaction to an iodine contrast agent used for x-rays or CT scans. You may need to stop taking certain medications before your TSH test. These include: There is no risk involved in having this blood test. Normal values for TSH range from 0.5 to 3 mill units per liter (mU/L). However, there’s no single answer for what constitutes normal TSH levels. Your doctor will use your results and other information to determine whether your thyroid is underactive or overactive. For example: Suppose your TSH level is below 0.5 mU/L, but other hormones are within the normal range. In that case, you may have subclinical hypothyroidism (low thyroid function) or Hashimoto’s disease (an autoimmune disorder that causes thyroid inflammation). In these cases, treatment with synthetic thyroid hormone may be needed to bring your levels back into balance. If your TSH level is between 4 and 10 mU/L, but all other hormones are within the normal range, you may have normal thyroid function with a slight increase in antibodies in your bloodstream. Regarding thyroid health, knowing how much of each hormone you have circulating through your bloodstream at any given time is essential. The thyroid gland also needs iodine to produce these hormones. Iodine is found naturally in foods such as milk, eggs, and seafood. Iodized salt contains added iodine to ensure that people get enough of this mineral daily. When your thyroid produces too much or too little TSH, it can harm your metabolism — increasing or decreasing your body’s ability to make energy from food sources such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. From a practical standpoint, the biggest draw of TSH testing is that it’s convenient. It’s fast and easy, and most people have no problem with it. However, because there are other thyroid function tests available, you should discuss with your doctor which test(s) will give you the best idea of what’s going on with your body. The TSH test can serve as an avenue to finding out where things stand concerning your thyroid levels without having to go through any hassle or spend thousands of dollars.

Diseases/ Symptoms,Difference between X-rays and CT scans,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/difference-between-x-rays-and-ct-scans/,"The human body is a complicated machine. We need to rely on diagnostic imaging instead of simply taking a doctor’s word for it. Does this mean there is something wrong with you if you require an imaging technique? No, various medical imaging techniques can help improve your quality of life by helping prevent other problems from arising later in life or aiding your doctor in making the right treatment decision. Let’s talk about two standard imaging techniques used to diagnose problems in the human body –X-rays and CT scans. These tests either look at the surface of your body or dig deeper into the insides of your body. The former is what we call “diagnostic imaging,” and the latter is “diagnostic testing.” Let’s see what they are meant by and how they are used: X-rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation (also called “light”), which has a very short wavelength (10 nanometers) and a high frequency. This makes them useful for describing the structure of matter on a small scale — below about 100 nanometers. They are used in the health sector as an imaging procedure that uses a minimal amount of radiation, which quickly goes through your body to capture an internal image of the body. X-ray scans create images on film. This radiation passes through soft tissues like skin and muscle but cannot pass through hard tissues such as bones or teeth. They produce images that are useful for diagnosing problems with bones, joints, and internal organs. They allow us to see inside the body without having to perform surgery or use a contrast agent, which is why they are so helpful in treating medical conditions and diagnosing diseases. They may be taken from any part of the body, including the skull, spine, chest, and abdomen. They also help doctors determine if there is fluid around the lungs (pulmonary edema). X-ray scans are often used to detect tumors in the brain and other body parts. It may be taken as part of a routine checkup or after symptoms appear. It can also be used to look for signs of disease in people who already have cancer or another serious medical condition. There are two types of x-rays: 1.Soft X-rayswith a wavelength of about 10 nanometers are soft x-rays (a nanometer is one billionth of a meter). Thus, they can be placed in the electromagnetic spectrum (EM) between gamma rays and ultraviolet (UV) light. 2.Hard x-rayshave wavelengths of about 100 picometers (a picometer is a trillionth of a meter). These waves are found in the same band as gamma rays on the electromagnetic spectrum. A CT scan (CT stands for computed tomography) is a particular type of X-ray that allows the radiologist to view multiple cross-sectional images of the body. It uses computer technology to produce detailed images of the inside of your body. It is a more detailed type of X-ray that uses the power of X-rays and computers to deliver a 3D view of your body. A CT scan makes many detailed slices (pictures), which then are merged into one projection. This creates a clear view that shows the position, shape, and size of the organs in your body. The CT scanner is a vast machine with an opening that you lie in. The machine then takes a series of X-ray images from different angles and, from these images, creates a 3D picture of your organs. There are two types of CT scan: 1.PET (CT) Scan: PET (positron emission tomography) uses a small amount of radioactive material called a tracer injected into your vein. As the tracer moves through your body, its path can be tracked by a special camera. The tracer reveals areas where cells are active, which helps doctors detect certain diseases like cancer more quickly than other tests. It is used to detect abnormal cells in the body, especially those in your brain. It may also be used to detect tumors in your lungs or liver. 2.CT Urography:A urography is an x-ray test used to look at the kidneys and urinary tract. It involves injecting contrast dye into your bladder through a tube inserted into your urethra (the tube that drains urine from the bladder). The dye makes it easier for doctors to see abnormalities, such as stones or tumors, which might be causing symptoms such as pain or blood in your urine. Here are some differences to be noted between X-ray and CT scans. The difference between X-rays and CT scans is relatively minor, but it is nevertheless significant. 1. X-rays use a single beam of radiation to produce an image. A CT scan uses many X-ray beams at different angles around the body, which are then combined by a computer into one image. This combines the benefits of both X-ray and MRI scans. 2. CT scans provide more detailed images than x-rays. The advantage of a CT scan is that it creates 3D images from the images of the lungs and heart, in contrast to an X-ray which is only 2D. This means any abnormality in the lungs or heart will be detected by the CT scan quickly. 3. X-rays are one type of ionizing radiation, which means they have enough energy to knock electrons off atoms and damage DNA. This damage can cause cancer and other diseases such as leukemia or thyroid cancer if you are exposed for long periods or if you receive multiple exposures at once. But it is much safer for pregnant women and children than CT scans. 4. The disadvantage of the CT scan is that it may not be suitable for everyone. For example, children may not be able to lie still enough for this test, and if you have a pacemaker, this could interfere with the test results. 5. X-rays are also used for non-medical purposes, such as airport security screening or manufacturing quality control. 6. X-ray is faster than a CT scan because it does not require any contrast medium or radiation exposure like CT does; however it does not provide enough detail for examining soft tissues such as muscles and ligaments (as opposed to bones). It may also miss some damage that is not visible on plain X-rays. The key differences between the two procedures are that CT scans are more detailed and come with a higher radiation dose. On the flip side, if you have an underlying issue but present minor symptoms, an X-ray might be your best bet. A CT scan is your go-to approach if you know you have an underlying medical condition or if you’re already experiencing severe symptoms. Both tests provide valuable information about your condition and can help determine the course of your treatment. Hope this article helped you better understand the differences between X-rays and CT scans and make an educated decision. As we have already said, both tools are used for different purposes since they highlight different structures within the body. Choosing between the two depends on your doctor’s preferences, among other things. We are happy to assist you. If you need an X-ray or CT scan, contactDr. Remedies Labs.

Diseases/ Symptoms,5 Things You Should Know About Urine Routine Test,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/5-things-you-should-know-about-urine-routine-test/,"Paying attention to the changes in your urine can be quite helpful in everyday life. Many factors can influence your ability to pass aUrine Routine Test– including age, health, family history, and medication – the color and consistency of your urine result from these factors. This can influence your health, especially if there is a significant change. You need to know a few things about urine routine tests and how they’re done. A routine urine test is one type of test that can be performed to check your overall health. Urinary routine testsare used to screen for different urinary tract disorders. It is a test to measure the appearance of your urine. The test helps to evaluate the microorganisms present in the urine and their susceptibility to treatment. The urine that passes through our kidneys has a balance of water, urea, hemoglobin, etc., in the form of human waste. If you are running a fever and feel lethargic, then the normal levels may be disturbed, leading to an increase in the level of white blood cells. The urine routine test measures levels ofprotein, glucose, and red blood cells in your urine. These three components are generally present in urine, but if they increase or decrease abnormally, it can indicate an illness or problem with kidney function. These substances are produced abnormally by your body when you have a UTI (urinary tract infection), kidney damage, or kidney disease. A UTI is usually caused by bacteria entering your urethra from the vagina or rectum and traveling up into the bladder, where they multiply rapidly to cause an infection. In addition to detecting high blood pressure, kidney disease, metabolic disorders likehypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, and evendiabetes mellitus(type 1 & type 2), a urine routine test can detect other conditions that affect your body. Burning on urination, frequency of urinating, bloody or cloudy urine, Chills, Fever, Back pain, Edema or swelling, loss of appetite, Nausea, Vomiting, Fatigue, Sleepiness, Itching, Twitching, and Metallic taste in the mouth. Here are some things you can do to prepare for this test: Drink plenty of fluids before you arrive at the doctor’s office or laboratory to have enough urine for the test. You can also drink more water after your visit if necessary. Do not use any diuretics (water pills) or laxatives (medications that cause bowel movements) 24 hours before your appointment, as these may interfere with test results( Except when advised by your doctor). A urine routine test typically involves taking a urine sample and sending it to a laboratory for analysis. The lab will then look at the sample under a microscope and analyze it to determine whether it contains any abnormal substances. Urine routine tests are performed to evaluate specific parameters of the urine. The urine analysis is done to detect and measure the concentration of urine electrolytes, blood cells, glucose, ketones, nitrites, proteins, and other substances. The most common method for measuring urine parameters isspectrophotometry(colorimetry). A particular instrument called aspectrophotometermeasures how much light is absorbed by the sample when it is exposed to different wavelengths of light. The amount of absorption depends on the concentration of the substance being measured. The advantage of spectrophotometry is that it can be performed on small samples (microliters) quickly (less than 5 minutes). The routine test is a simple, quick, and efficient way to measure the health of your kidneys. The test involves collecting a urine sample at home and sending it to a lab for analysis. The lab will then provide you with results within a few days. Urine Albumin Test:This test is done to determine if there is blood in the urine. The presence of blood can indicate damage to the kidneys or urinary tract. Urine Culture:A sample is taken from the urine and then incubated for 24 hours to see if any bacterial growth occurs. This can help identify an infection in the urinary tract. Creatinine: Creatinine is a waste product that results from protein breakdown in your body. It is present in your blood and also excreted in your urine. The amount present in your urine depends on how much you drink and how well your kidneys function. This test measures the amount of creatinine in your urine and indicates how well your kidneys are working. The urine routine test measures specific compounds in urine that can indicate various diseases and disorders. For example, if the test shows high glucose levels (sugar), it may indicate diabetes mellitus.
