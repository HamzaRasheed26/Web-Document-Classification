Food,Canola vs. Vegetable Oil: What’s the Difference?,"By Layla Khoury-Hanold for Food Network Kitchen Layla Khoury-Hanold is a contributor at Food Network. These common cooking oils look similar, but there are several differences between them. Here’s everything you need to know about canola oil and vegetable oil, including whether or not you can use them interchangeably. What Is Canola Oil? And What Is Canola Oil Made Of? Also known as rapeseed oil, canola oilis a type of vegetable oil made from the rapeseed plant that has a neutral taste and high smoke point of 400 degrees F. Canola oil was invented in the 1970s in Canada, which is a major producer of rapeseed. Canola was developed to be an edible version of the rapeseed plant. Canola is short for ""Canadian Oil Low Acid."" Is Canola Oil Bad for You? ""No, canola oil is not bad for you,"" says, Toby Amidor, MS, RD, CDN, FAND award-winning nutrition expert and Wall Street Journal bestselling author of Up Your Veggies: Flexitarian Recipes for the Whole Family. ""Canola oil is categorized as a monounsaturated fat which has been shown to help reduce the risk of heart disease."" Additionally, she says, canola's mild flavor and high smoke point mean it can be used for high-heat cooking methods, like frying, as well as in baked goods. ""All oils, including canola oil, consist of 120 calories and 14g of total fat per tablespoon,"" she adds. ""It also consists of 21% omega-6 fatty acids and 11% of omega-3 fatty acids. All vegetable oils are made of some combination of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and saturated fat."" Why Is Canola Oil Banned in Europe? ""The concern in Europe about canola oil is due to the erucic acid content in canola oil. Research has suggested that there potentially may be harmful effects of erucic acid, which is a compound found in canola oil,"" Amidor explains. ""Europe has stricter standards on the amount of erucic acid in oil and therefore it is banned. In other countries, the erucic acid levels in canola oil meets their guidelines—it is just that Europe has stricter guidelines."" Canola Oil Substitutions For canola oil substitutions, seek out other neutral oils such as grapeseed oil, safflower oil, expeller-pressed oil or a high-quality, all-purpose vegetable oil. What Is Vegetable Oil? Vegetable oil is a type of cooking oil that is made from plants or seeds. Vegetable oil has a neutral flavor and high smoke point, around 400 degrees F. Different types of vegetable oil include canola, soybean, olive, avocado, coconut or sunflower oil. All-purpose vegetable oils, like most of the ones sold in grocery stores, are typically soybean or corn oil, or a combination of the two. What Can Replace Vegetable Oil You can replace vegetable oil with other plant-based oils such as canola, grapeseed, sunflower, avocado or corn oil. In baking, you can replace vegetable oil with applesauce or mashed bananas. For frying, peanut oil can be used as a replacement for vegetable oil. For sauteeing, a light olive oil, butter or ghee can be substituted for vegetable oil. Amidor notes that avocado oil can impart a slightly green color to your dish, which can be a visual issue with baking, and even lighter olive oils impart a stronger flavor than vegetable oil. Canola vs. Vegetable Oil Canola and vegetable oil are both common types of plant-based cooking oils with have high smoke points, but their base ingredients, appearance and nutritional values are different. Base ingredient. Canola oil comes from the rapeseed plant, whereas vegetable oil is made from plants or seeds. Composition. Canola oil is made from a singular plant while vegetable oil can be made from one plant or seed or a combination of plant-based oils. Appearance. Canola oil and most vegetable oils sold in grocery store are pale yellow in color, but since the composition of vegetable oils can vary, vegetable oils may take on different colors ranging from gold to yellow to green. Nutrition. Amidor says that all vegetable oils are made of some combination of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and saturated fat, but canola oil is considered a monounsaturated fat. Depending on the composition of the vegetable oil, it may be classified differently. Canola oil consists of 21% omega-6 fatty acids and 11% omega-3 fatty acids, so it may be considered healthier than vegetable oil. Does It Matter If You Use Canola or Vegetable Oil? You can use canola oil and vegetable oil interchangeably. Canola oil and vegetable oil are both neutral oils with high smoke points, making them good choices for baking, frying and sauteeing. Keep in mind that the composition of most vegetable oils sold in store can vary by manufacturer, but it should not affect the flavor or texture of your recipe.

Food,The Truth Behind These Super-Common Sports Nutrition Myths,"Everyone from professional athletes to occassional gym-goers are considering the latest sports nutrition methods to get that performance edge. The problem is, these crazy-popular strategies aren't always all they're cracked up to be. We asked our nutritionist to break down common sports nutrition trends to find out which ones really work and which ones should be sidelined. Myth: Pickle Juice Cures Muscle Cramps In recent weeks, closet pickle juice sippers are coming out of the shadows and proudly chugging day-glow pickle juice on social media. According to the rumor mill, pickle juice helps exercise induced muscle cramping, which can be caused by a variety of factors including lack of fluids, electrolyte depletion and under-fueling (not eating enough calories). Some athletes have reported that tipping back some pickle juice after cramps start helps to shut down and shorten the duration of symptoms, but according to research, this relief may be more about the jolt of acidity from acetic acid in the pickle juice rather than the electrolytes floating in that salty green liquid. Plus, small studies from 2009 and 2014 found no big changes in electrolyte blood concentrations from drinking pickle juice which may mean it won’t give the boost you're expecting. Bottom line: Pickle juice may be worth trying for those that cramp often, but those prone to heartburn or suffering from hypertension may find this can do more harm than good! Traditional forms of replenishment such as sports drinks, high sodium and high potassium foods should remain go-to sources of recovery. There’s no need to down pickle juice if you find it gross or hard to swallow (literally). Myth: You're Not Eating Enough Protein Gram for gram, most folks tend to take in plenty of protein per day. Though the type of exercise and level of intensity may dictate a need to increase that protein dosage. On average, an athletic 150-pound person requires about 70 grams of protein a day which can be achieved by eating 2 eggs for breakfast, 6 ounces of chicken with lunch or dinner and 6 ounces of Greek yogurt as a snack. For best results, protein intake should be spread out throughout the entire day and should come from sources with a wide range of amino acids (the building blocks of proteins in the body). Protein sources with all those amino acids can be found in animal-based foods (eggs, dairy, meat) as well as plant-based foods like quinoa, soy, or combinations of grains and legumes such as rice and beans. Bottom line: Aim for high-quality protein and be sure to spread your intake throughout the day to maximize your performance. Myth: Go Keto High fat, low carb, Paleo- and Ketogenic-style diets continue to flood the news cycle but don’t believe the hype surrounding these fads. Aside from being incredibly hard to adhere to, these programs can also be dangerous when followed long term. Excluding food groups means cutting back carbs, vitamins and minerals, which can lead to nutrient deficiencies, illness and injury. Bottom Line: Fad diets like Keto could lead to decreased performance. Myth: Coconut Water Is Better Than Sports Drinks Bottled versions of coconut water (the clear liquid from the inside of coconuts) have become a fridge staple in many households. They're touted as a natural alternative to sports drinks, but there’s more to the story. Like sports drinks, coconut water can provide some fluid and carbs, but the electrolyte composition is very different. Sports drinks are modeled after sweat and contain more sodium than potassium, but coconut water contains little sodium and 4 to 5 times more potassium. Bottom Line: Since sweat losses typically yield more sodium lost than potassium, some sweaters may want to reach for a sports drink with more salt instead of coconut water. Myth: You Need More BCAAs Branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) are the specific group of amino acids vital to muscle building. This is why you can find them added to a staggering number of pills, powders and other products marketed to athletes and fitness enthusiasts. However, a study from 2017 found that these BCAA supplements fall short in their ability to build muscle. The truth is, better BCAAs (that actually help build muscle) can be found in large amounts in foods like eggs, chicken, beef and cottage cheese. Bottom Line: More is not better. Eat your BCAAs through healthy food instead of reaching for supplements. Related Links: The Long-Term Risks of a Keto Diet The Best Foods for Athletes Healthy Chicken Recipes",747
Food,The Ultimate Healthy Cooking Playlist," When it comes time to rustle up a meal, you might prefer soothing jazz or even classical music in your kitchen. Or maybe you get down to 1970s-era Elton John, just like Alton Brown. Unless you prefer serene silence, it can be helpful to have a backbeat energizing your latest cooking venture. Here’s a playlist to inspire some healthy creations at home. ""A Taste of Honey"" — Herb Alpert (pictured at top) Prepare these versatile, lightly sweetened biscuits for a comforting brunch, or serve them alongside the main course at dinnertime. Given that there's only three tablespoons of honey per 12 biscuits, you really are getting just a taste. ""Tangerine"" — Led Zeppelin If you take a page out of Led Zeppelin’s book, you might find yourself “measuring a summer’s day” by the quality of the produce you prepare at home. Tangerine and rosemary make a tart and earthy dressing for fresh spinach and tender cubes of butternut squash. ""Apples and Oranges"" — Pink Floyd They say you can’t compare apples and oranges, but we can certainly talk about their tart, semi-sweet flavor in this light dessert salad recipe. Orange marmalade, almond extract and dried cherries make a perfumed and slightly sweet dressing for crisp apple slices. ""Pork and Beans"" — Weezer Unlike Weezer, I wouldn’t recommend eating candy with this dish of pork and beans, but a red-onion-and-bell-pepper salad makes a colorful side for few extra calories. These sauteed peppers and onions are just sweet enough to stand up to the peppery flavor of the cumin-roasted pork. ""Vegetables"" — The Beach Boys When The Beach Boys sang, “I’m gonna chow down my vegetables/I love you most of all,” they weren't referring to salad. But this bountiful dish of eggplant, zucchini and bell pepper would appease even the most-lovesick songsters. A light dressing of oil, vinegar and oregano ties together this medley of fresh summer produce. For a Mediterranean touch, stir in some mint, halved grape tomatoes and crumbled feta just before serving. ""American Pie"" — Don McLean It doesn’t get more American than apple pie. Unwind to this classic summer anthem while preparing Ellie Krieger's irresistible from-scratch recipe. The rustic galette-style crust houses buttery Golden Delicious apples and tart cherries. Guests will hardly believe there are just 230 calories per serving. ""Peaches"" — The Presidents of the United States of America Despite what The Presidents of the United States of America said, you don’t really need to move to the country to eat a lot of peaches. Chances are, you'll find all the fresh stone fruit you'll need to create this crowd-pleasing Healthy Peach Betty at your local farmers' market this summer. Just make sure your peaches are ripe — it makes a huge difference in the finished dish. ""Real Girls Eat Cake"" — The Janoskians Who ever said they don’t? You’ll be hard-pressed to find an audience that’s not head-over-heels in love with this moist cinnamon cake. Coconut oil and applesauce help create the dense, springy texture. It’s just an added perk that the cake happens to be gluten-free, thanks to the garbanzo-fava bean flour blend.",518
Food,The FDA Just Approved a Major Health Claim for Yogurt,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for managing and policing claims companies can make about food products. This includes language and allowable criteria for claims about health benefits based on scientific evidence. For example, a company cannot claim that a food may help reduce the risk of osteoporosis unless it meets established criteria for calcium content. There is a lot of time, effort and consideration that goes into these claims and the process can take years; even words like “healthy” and “natural” are evaluated. Food manufacturers often play a role in the development of these claims based on their reviews of scientific evidence. With that, the FDA recently announced a qualified health claim about yogurt, and its potential to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Given the time and evidence required to get such a claim approved, the development is monumental. Here’s what you need to know. What Is a Qualified Health Claim? There are various types and categories of claims depending on food and health conditions. Qualified Health Claims (QHC) are supported by scientific evidence but do not meet the standards required for a Significant Scientific Agreement (SSA), which includes more substantiated evidence that a relationship between a food and disease exist. QHCs are also accompanied by disclaimers or other qualifying language to help consumers best understand the claims. Let’s Talk Yogurt In a recent petition made by Danone North America, a QHC was filed to support the link between yogurt and type 2 diabetes. Amanda Blechman, Registered Dietitian and Director of Health and Scientific Affairs at Danone North America, explains this extensive process. “To file a petition for the claim, we thoroughly reviewed the body of existing research related to yogurt and type 2 diabetes, and submitted a total of 32 studies, which included data from more than 300,000 individuals, to the FDA for review along with the qualified health claim that we were proposing to summarize the evidence for consumers.” The FDA then set forth the following language for this claim as “eating yogurt regularly, at least 2 cups (3 servings) per week, may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes according to limited scientific evidence.” There is a lot of variation in nutrient profiles of yogurt when it comes protein and added sugar content, but no matter what style you prefer there are beneficial nutrients such as live, active cultures that act as probiotics that work along with the lactose in yogurt that may be playing a role in the reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. Blechman agrees there is flexibility in the type of yogurts that can be considered beneficial, but the claim is specific to dairy-based yogurts. “We at Danone recognize the important role that both dairy products and plant-based alternatives can play,” adds Blechman. However, “research that informed this claim was focused on yogurt made from dairy milk, so the new claim will not apply to plant-based yogurt alternatives.” How Can You Get More Servings of Yogurt Each Week? If getting more servings of yogurt is now on your to-do list, take advantage of the variety and versatility by adding yogurt to both sweet and savory dishes. And no matter which yogurt varieties you choose, you can benefit from the bone-building calcium it contains. “One of the many things I love about yogurt is that it’s accessible, it’s versatile and it fits within a wide variety of eating patterns and occasions,” adds Blechman. “Yogurt is a staple in my family’s grocery cart, and we like to enjoy it with fruit, mix it into smoothies, dips, and dressings, and even use it as a cooking or baking ingredient – there are so many easy ways to integrate more yogurt into your daily diet! For many, it is a nutrient-dense addition to a breakfast meal with fruit and whole grain cereal, a quick snack between meetings, or a sweet treat after a meal.” *This article was written and/or reviewed by an independent registered dietitian nutritionist.

Food,Zero Waste: 7 Ways You Can Protect the Environment When You Shop,"We’ve all gotten the memo: Bring a reusable bag for grocery shopping whenever you can, and choose paper over plastic when you can't. But what other things can you do to make the least amount of impact on the environment when you’re shopping for groceries? Here are a few, along with some added incentives to adopt the reusable-bag habit.     1. Pack Reusable Bags   If you haven’t remembered to keep your reusable bag on you at all times, maybe this will encourage you to do so: Every time customers bring their own bag to Whole Foods they receive 10 cents off their purchase. If you bring your reusable bag to Trader Joe’s, you can enter your name into the daily raffle to win a gift certificate for the store just for being kind to the environment. If you’re near a Wegman’s, bring back your plastic bags and drop them in their designated recycling bin. The bags will be sent back to the supplier to be made into new plastic bags, thus creating a closed-loop system. (Note: If you’re having trouble keeping your reusable bags on you, each time you’ve unloaded your purchases, put the bags back into your car trunk, bicycle bag or handbag.)     2. Grab Your Mason Jar   In addition to using recyclable or reusable bags, bring a reusable container to collect your favorite bulk food products. Whole Foods (check with your local store) allows customers to use their own Mason jar (or other container) to stock up on their selection of nuts, seeds, grains and dried fruits.     3. Buy Precut Veggies   At Wegman’s, when you buy their already cleaned and chopped fruits and veggies you will be doing more than saving time. More than half of Wegman’s 85 stores divert food waste to be used for animal feed or compost, or to produce energy.     4. Skip the Produce Bags   Is it essential that you separate all your fruits and veggies into plastic bags?  If you’re worried the bananas will bruise or the zucchini will get nicked, take good care of them as you would your loaves of bread or your eggs: Make sure sensitive fruits and veggies go on top of other, more durable goods. At home you’ll have an easier time discovering what’s in your veggie drawer, as you won’t have to dig through a sea of plastic.  If you do use the plastic bags, remember to reuse them.     5. BYOB   A new trend in the olive oil world: bring your own bottle. Gourmet cheese shops that offer signature olive oil from a vat are selling refillable green bottles. Customers often receive a discount for reusing the bottle when they fuel up on the liquid gold once again.     6. Take a Lunch   Nowadays the grocery store has also become the eatery. If you are heading to Whole Foods for their hot/cold bar, skip the takeaway and take a lunch break. Customers who opt to eat in and use their reusable bowls receive a price break — another reason not to eat at your desk.     7. Don’t Forget Why You Should Buy Local   When shopping, look for local foods that have traveled fewer miles to the grocery store. Choosing sustainable seafood, organic meats and poultry, green cleaning products and energy-efficient light bulbs are all good decisions. The store is filled with choices that promise to make the planet and your home a greener place.

Food,Are We Drinking Too Much? New Guidelines Suggest We Might Be,"For the last five years, the recommendation for alcohol consumption among men and women has been two drinks per day for men and one per day for women. You've probably come across headlines touting potential benefits of alcohol, but the truth is, consuming alcohol in moderation is not known to contribute to health benefits. And if you don't drink right now, there's no concrete evidence to that shows starting moderate alcohol consumption will make you healthier. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans are revised every five years, and 2020 marks a new revision. Prior to the release, an extensive scientific review committee is charged with evaluating research on topics new and old and making recommendations for what the guidelines will include. Here’s what the science experts are saying about alcohol consumption for men and women. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), six in 10 American adults suffer from chronic disease such as type 2 diabetes, cancer or obesity. Various factors contribute to the prevalence of chronic disease including poor nutrition, lack of physical activity, and excessive alcohol consumption. In the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines the recommendation for alcohol was a maximum of two drinks per day for men and one drink per day for women, if you choose to drink. One drink is defined as 12 fluid ounces of beer, 5 fluid ounces of wine, or 1 1/2 fluid ounces of 80-proof liquor (like rum or vodka). And no, you can’t accrue your weekly drinks to have seven or 14 drinks on a Saturday night. In addition, the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommended that that those who do not drink should not begin to drink because they believe alcohol would make them healthier. According to the new report, the evidence shows that drinking less is better for health compared to drinking more. In addition, the research found that among people who do drink, men are more likely to drink more than women. In addition, among folks ages 20 to 64 years of age, alcohol contributes more than 20% of total calories from beverages. As such, the committee made the recommendation to lower the guideline for men to a maximum of one drink per day. The recommendations for women of a maximum of one drink per day remained the same. However, Taylor C. Wallace, PhD CFS, FACN is CEO at Think Healthy Group and a professor in the Department of Nutrition and Food Studies at George Mason University disagrees with the recommendation. “The original protocol for alcohol and all-cause mortality included studies from 2000 to 2020, but was later revised to include only studies from 2010 to 2020 due to timing constraints. Systematic reviews of the scientific literature should never be conducted in this manner and should reflect the entire body of evidence,” says Wallace. In order to define what “moderate drinking” is, Wallace recommends conducting large randomized clinical trials as opposed to using observational studies. “We need to do our homework before giving pseudoscientific answers based on theoretical models verses what people really consume.” Bottom Line: You can enjoy alcohol, but in moderation. The committee reports recommendations provided to the government may not make it into the final 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines. Only time will tell.

Food,The Chef's Take: Grains and Egg Bowl from Camille Becerra,"Here's something you may not know about Camille Becerra, chef at the stylish New American seafood restaurant, Navy, in New York City's SoHo. Becerra studied macrobiotic cooking, prepared meals to heal cancer patients in Philadelphia and lived at a Zen monastery in New Mexico where she cooked vegetarian meals for the monks, sourcing ingredients from the on-premises garden. ""Through macrobiotic cooking, I saw the importance of food as a source of health,"" she says. ""I am always very interested in how food can heal and prevent illness."" At Navy, Becerra offers a menu that caters to locavore hipsters, with seasonal plates like black bass crudo with rhubarb and pine nuts, tilefish with tomato, avocado and almonds, and soft-shell crab with squash-blossom pancakes. But she's also partial to her macrobiotic roots. For the lunch menu, Becerra added this bowl of grains and eggs with an eye toward offering guests a midday meal that would energize. ""During the day, you don't want something super-rich that will potentially slow you down,"" she says. ""For the lunch menu, I focused on lighter dishes with lots of vegetables and superfoods."" The grains bowl is the perfect example of this philosophy at work. She uses a combination of assorted super grains -- red rice, quinoa, farro, wheatberries and brown rice -- and tosses them with fresh herbs. The grains are spooned over some sumac yogurt, then topped off with avocado, carrots, beets and root vegetables -- whatever's in season. A poached egg, some pickled shallots and lightly dressed greens crown the dish. Says Becerra: ""It’s good for you, it's full of flavor and it gives you the fuel you need for your day.""  Grains and Egg Bowl This isn't so much a recipe as a general formula: The beauty of this dish is its versatility. So use any cooked grains you have on hand and whatever vegetables are in season. Add some yogurt, greens and an egg on top, and you are all set.  Here's how Becerra says she proceeds:     I. Whole Grains   A mix of 2 or 3 types of cooked grains is lovely, for example; farro, red/brown/black rice, quinoa, wheatberries.     II. Roasted Vegetables   A mix also works very well, and I especially love the sweetness that root vegetables and squashes bring to the egg bowl, for example; carrots, beets, parsnips, butternut squash.     III. Savory Yogurt   Something magical happens when you mix sea salt and yogurt. With the addition of mild spices or herbs, you can create your own savory yogurt, for example: dill, dandelion, parsley, ground fennel or coriander seed. I always like to add a drop of honey or agave to balance the tartness of the yogurt. I am currently obsessed with sumac yogurt.     Sumac Yogurt       1 cup Greek (strained) yogurt       2 pinches sumac       1 pinch sea salt       ¼  teaspoon agave       IV. Fresh Greens and Herbs   Generally, I like to use watercress for its spicy bite and a mix of sliced scallions, chives and parsley. There are so many options for this fresh element to the egg bowl. Toss them slightly in olive oil, sea salt and a drop or two of lemon juice.     V. The Egg   At Navy, we serve the egg bowl with a poached egg, but a fried egg is also so wonderful. A pinch of chili powder atop of the egg is key. Finally, drizzle it all with some fruity olive oil and sea salt. A real pleaser for breakfast, lunch or dinner.

Food,"The Chef's Take: Lentil, Avocado and Kale Salad from Franklin Becker","In 1997, Franklin Becker was a 27-year-old chef whose star was on the rise. That same year, he was also diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes. The disease not only changed the way he ate, but it also changed the way he cooked. Becker, who was most recently the corporate chef of the EMM Group, overseeing menus for New York City restaurants Abe & Arthurs, CATCH and Lexington Brass, learned to use simple ingredients, to cook with more vegetables and to add flavor to food by using good fats such as olive oil, nuts and avocados.""I realized that if certain ingredients were bad for me to eat, they were probably not great for my guests to eat either,"" Becker says. At the time Becker began tweaking his own menus, New York was a very center-of-the-plate, protein-driven city. ""It was a bit of a departure, but that has changed over the past 10 years."" Becker says. ""We are now in an era where a lot of people are whole-foods-driven. They are looking at alternative grains like quinoa, amaranth and millet, and they want to eat more vegetables."" Becker's latest concept, The Little Beet, which opened in January, capitalizes on the shift in attitude and appetite. Come lunchtime, the fast-casual spot in Midtown -- which specializes in local, seasonal, gluten-free and veg-heavy eats -- is packed with suits who have traded in their subs and slices for the likes of buckwheat soba noodles, charred kale, roasted sweet potatoes and brown rice. With The Little Beet, which is on track to hit the $5 million mark for sales this year, Becker and his partners have clearly struck a chord. Three more of the restaurants are slated to open in the coming year, with two more in Manhattan and one on Long Island. Becker's highly-anticipated Little Beet Table, a full-service restaurant based on the same model of seasonal, wholesome, ingredient-driven food, will open in October. Becker's lentil salad with avocado and kale is The Little Beet's No. 1 best-seller and is also featured in Becker's upcoming cookbook, Good Fat Cooking, co-authored with Peter Kaminsky. Due out in late October, the book is an ode to Becker's whole-food philosophy and to the good fats found in avocado, olive oil and nuts. ""Eat more good fats, and you help prevent everything from heart issues to diabetes,"" Becker says. ""This salad delivers all the benefits of good fats -- and it tastes great."" Lentil Salad with Avocado, Oranges and Kale Serves 4 For the lemon vinaigrette:     2 ounces fresh lemon juice       2 ounces white balsamic vinegar       2 ounces lemon-flavored extra virgin olive oil       4 ounces extra virgin olive oil       1 teaspoon kosher salt       Pinch black pepper   For the salad:     4 ounces cooked lentils       2 tablespoons toasted pecans       1 cup baby kale       2 tablespoons orange juice       1 ounce orange segments       3 tablespoons diced avocado       1 tablespoon minced parsley   Whisk together all of the vinaigrette ingredients. Toss the lentils, pecans, kale, orange juice and orange segments with the vinaigrette. Garnish with avocado and parsley.

Food,Are You a Healthy Snacker?,"We have become a snacking nation, but that doesn’t mean everyone snacks healthfully. Snacking on high calorie foods with few nutrients can lead to weight gain and unhealthy eating habits. And mindlessly munching on a bag of chips (yes, even veggie chips!) in front of the TV at night is not a healthy habit either. So how can you tell if you’re a healthy snacker? See how you answer the following 5 questions. 1. Are you having a snack or a treat? A snack is a mini meal that provides nutrients you may not be getting enough of during regular meals, such as fiber, calcium, vitamin D and potassium. A treat is a food that provides very little (if any) nutrition, but contains a lot of calories such as a doughnut or bag of potato chips. To become a healthy snacker: Think before eating. If it’s a snack, then enjoy it! If it’s a treat, ask yourself if you really need it and if not, swap it for a healthier choice. 2.Do you really need the snack? Snacks shouldn’t be eaten just for the sake of having something in your mouth or to alleviate boredom. They should be eaten if you are truly hungry, like if you go five or more hours between meals without food (not counting sleep time). To become a healthy snacker: Pre-plan snack times one to two times per day when you find yourself the hungriest 3. Are you carb-overloading? Although whole grain pretzels or crackers sound like a healthy snack, they’re more satisfying when combined with a protein or healthy fat which helps slow down digestion and keep you satisfied for longer. To become a healthy snacker: Combine carbs with protein or healthy fat such as Greek yogurt topped with berries, or whole grain crackers topped with peanut butter. 4. Are you controlling your portions? Having the right foods and the right time is important, but you also need to eat these foods in appropriate portions. Some foods are very healthy, but when eaten in large quantities can add hundreds of unnecessary calories to your day. To become a healthy snacker: Aim to have snacks between 125 to 200 calories each. Review the nutrition facts panel of packaged foods for recommended serving sizes and calories per serving. 5. Are you a packaged food snacker? Many packaged foods aren’t as healthy as they seem. Some may contain few calories…but few vitamins and minerals too. Other can be laden with artery clogging fat and loads of calories. To become a healthy snacker: Control the ingredients by preparing a few snacks at home.

Food,Market Watch: Pomegranates,"With the advent of icy weather, the fruit selection at the market begins to look a little ho-hum. But then the festive, red pomegranate arrives on the scene. Encased in its shiny rind are hundreds of juicy, jewel-like seeds — called “arils” by those in the know. One of the oldest known fruits, pomegranates immigrated to California along with Spanish missionaries in the 1700s. Nowadays, the majority of the U.S. crop is grown in the dry San Joaquin valley. Though they’re available starting in late fall, it’s not until December that I finally take notice. Then, I find myself using these sweet-tart seeds to brighten up any number of wintry dishes.  How to Crack ‘Em Tackling a pomegranate takes a bit of know-how. Of course, you can simply split the fruit in half and laboriously tease out the seeds from the bitter, white membranes. But here’s a slightly quicker method: First, slice off the crown end with a sharp knife. Then make a series of shallow, vertical slits down the raised ridges. Break the fruit into sections and bend each section backwards to pop out the seeds. Pomegranate Facts Pomegranates are an excellent source of vitamin C, providing almost half the daily recommended value in a single serving, not to mention healthy amounts of vitamin K, folate, and potassium. They are also one of nature’s best sources of polyphenols, antioxidants that are thought to prevent both heart disease and cancer. At the market, choose shiny, deep red to purplish pomegranates that feel heavy for their size, avoiding those that are cracked or blemished. Uncut, pomegranates will last in the fridge for up to two months. You can refrigerate the seeds for about three days and freeze them up to six months. What to Do with Pomegranates A scattering of pomegranate seeds makes any dish look fancy in a flash. To make a salad fit for the holiday table, combine thinly sliced fennel, endives, and oranges, dress with a lemony vinaigrette, and garnish with fennel fronds and pomegranate seeds. For a quick winter cocktail, you can’t beat champagne or non-alcoholic cider topped with floating pomegranate seeds. You can even incorporate them into a gift for the hostess: Take your favorite chocolate bark recipe and add a shower of pomegranate seeds (press them in to help them adhere). Since the pomegranate originally hails from the Middle East, the seeds are found in many recipes from the region. Try them sprinkled over roasted chicken thighs, glazed with pomegranate molasses (a concentrated form of the juice available in higher-end grocery stores). They also lend their sweetness and crunch to grain salads: Mix them with bulgur or quinoa, toasted walnuts, lots of chopped parsley, and feta cheese. To make a comforting and ultra-healthy hot beverage, simmer pomegranate seeds in water for about 15 minutes. Serve hot, with honey and a strip of orange peel.

Food,Ask The Experts: 11 Healthy Cooking Mistakes,"Healthy cooking isn't rocket science, but there are mistakes many folks make that keep their foods from being as nutritious as they could be.  Last month, we polled nutrition experts about the foods they avoid; this month we polled more top nutritionists and registered dietitians to find out the most common healthy cooking faux pas. From Our Experts I always urge people to read the entire recipe before they make it – nothing ruins a healthy recipe like skipping a step or realizing at the last minute that you don’t have a necessary ingredient. A little forethought is all you need to help make any recipe a success. The rest of the Healthy Eats team notices that a lot of folks over-process their fruits and veggies and have a tendency to get a little too saucy: “Refrain from peeling your fruits and veggies as the skin is packed with nutrients.  Buy organic and give them a good wash before using they enjoy the texture and nutrition those peels provides … (and) … Don’t boil your veggies as it leaches the nutrients.  Try a quick pan steam with a little bit of water for tasty, tender yet crisp veggies.  Feel the need to boil -- save the water for cooking grains or soups.” -Katie Cavuto Boyle “Many of my clients admit they'll use way too much sauce (teriyaki, sweet and sour, BBQ, etc.) when marinating food or making a stir fry. Typically the serving size is only 2 tablespoons, but they'll pour on closer to 1/4 cup, which is filling an otherwise healthy dish with loads of unnecessary calories, sugar and sodium. I recommend using less sauce and adding more flavor with fresh herbs, spices, or lemon zest.” –Janel Ovrut “Some people like to slice up fruits and veggies so they’re ready to snack on. This is a great idea for a healthy snack, but there are some things to keep in mind. Slice fruits and veggies in large chunks—the smaller the size, the easier the vitamins are destroyed. Also, prepare enough food for only a day or so---the longer it sits around, the less vitamins are present.” -Toby Amidor National Experts We got a wide variety of responses, many touched on less-than-healthy substitutions that are commonly thought of as ""better for you"".  The take home message – enjoy REAL foods. Taste Bias “Many of my culinary students will say to me that they're surprised at how delicious the food is. Too many people are still under the impression that healthy food isn't supposed to taste great. Get over it! When prepared using fresh, real ingredients, healthy food is tasty food.” -Jackie Newgent, RD, CDN, culinary nutritionist, author of Big Green Cookbook. Read the recent Healthy Eats interview with Jackie. Misunderstanding Calorie From Fat “Butter, for example, has an unhealthy halo due to the saturated fat content; we know that saturated fats are bad for our heart health. Olive oil, on the other hand has a healthy halo due to its unsaturated fat content, and we know that unsaturated fats are good for heart health.  The heart health message seems to have gotten through; however, many people think that if they are on a weigh loss diet, substituting olive oil for butter will aid in their weight loss goals. It is important to understand that a tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of olive oil (and any other fat, including lard, canola oil, corn oil, beef tallow, etc...) all have the same number of calories. The unsaturated fats are over all 'healthier' fats, but when evaluating fats, one must realize that they are still a major contributor to calories in the diet.” -Chef Kyle Shadix, MS, RD,certified chef de cuisine & culinary nutrition communications consultant Assuming “Organic” Always Means Healthy “Choosing to go all organic is a great thing (if you can do it) but many people don’t understand that just because junk food (chips, cookies, cakes, ice cream, candy and more) is organic it doesn’t necessarily mean it is the best choice. I find that many people believe that buying organic makes them immune to health problems.” - Stefanie Bryn Sacks, M.S.,Culinary Nutritionist, food counselor, nutrition educator and chef instructor Not Checking Labels on Ground Meats “Buying turkey burgers in place of 93% lean beef without reading the fat content. If the turkey burgers contain the skin, then they are often higher in fat than a beef patty--in this case you'd be better off getting the extra iron at a lower calorie load by going with the beef burger.” - Melissa Halas-Liang, MA RD CDE, founder of www.superkidsnutrition.com Swapping Out The Real Thing “I tell folks: A little bit of full-flavored, full fat cheese is better than any mountain you can create of fat-free cheese!  There is so little flavor in fat-free cheese that people end up grating up a mountain of the stuff just to generate the flavor they think they are getting!   Use the real stuff; a little goes so far, and you know exactly what the ingredients are! - Amanda Archibald, R.D.,founder/owner, Field to Plate “Substituting 100 percent (full fat) with the fat-free version and trying to replace every bit of fat (or sugar) with a non-fat or sugar-free alternative.  I say enjoy the real thing, just don’t overdo the real thing!” -Christopher R. Mohr, PhD, RD, exercise physiologist and registered dietitian of www.MohrResults.com “People try to use sugar substitutes in baked goods, especially cookies.  Sugar provides many roles in the baking process, and using a sugar substitute in place of the real stuff just changes the taste, texture, and the way your baked goods will look.  I suggest using real sugar in recipes and reduce the amount that the recipe calls for by 1/4. Generally, the baked good will come out just fine and you have successfully reduced some of the added sugar.” - Julie Upton, MS, R.D., freelance writer and co-founder of EatLikeanRD.com Forgetting the Flavor “I find that many of my clients go bland when cooking healthy.  They grill a chicken breast without seasoning, they forget to spice a stew or they make a low-fat sandwich without a bit of excitement.  I’m fine with their choices if they like the taste, but I worry if they consider their healthy meal a punishment.  Here’s my fix:  fresh thyme and rosemary goes a long way, get saucy with basil leaves, kick it up with chili pepper, give it an Indian twist with cumin and turmeric or shred some ginger.  For a sandwich, go for it with a spicy mustard, horseradish or cranberry relish.  Healthy meals do not have to be bland!” - Jenna A.

Food,Taste Test: Fast Food Oatmeal,"Oatmeal is the latest healthy food to hit fast food joints around the nation. But how healthy (and tasty) are these fast food versions? We tested some of the most popular offerings to see how they stacked up. The Criteria We visited 4 popular fast food and fast-casual restaurants that offer oatmeal as a breakfast option. We rated each on a 5-point scale (5 being highest) based on flavor, texture, cost and nutritional content, including the type of oats and how they’re prepared. Each restaurant offered various add-ins and flavors, which we found could sometimes sabotage a healthy cup of oatmeal. Starbucks' Perfect Oatmeal Rating: 4.0     Cost: $2.45 plus tax Nutrition Info Per Serving (38 grams): 140 calories; 2.5 grams fat; 0 grams sugar; 4 grams fiber Options: Any of the following can be mixed in: brown sugar (50 calories, 12 grams sugar), dried fruit (100 calories, 22 grams sugar), mixed nuts (100 calories, 1 gram sugar) Our Take: We were surprised to learn that oatmeal is available throughout the day at Starbucks. To make the mix, the barista blends instant oatmeal with hot water and gives you packets of your chosen toppings. The consistency was a bit thick and mushy, but a quick swirl with a spoon helped the water and oats combine better. The first ingredient is whole-grain rolled oats, but other listed ingredients include thickeners like oat flour and guar gum. In addition, the oatmeal includes added B-vitamins, iron and vitamin A. The oatmeal comes unsweetened, so you can cut down on added sugar and calories if you use only a touch of the sugar and choose either nuts or dried fruit. Cosi's Oatmeal Rating: 4.0   Cost: $2.99 plus tax   Nutrition Info Per Serving (7.5 ounces): 222 calories; 3 grams fat; 3 grams sugar; 4 grams fiber Options: Choose any two: pistachios, granola, dried cranberries, fresh strawberries, whipped cream, Cosi Break Bar Bits, raisins, brown sugar. Our Take: Oatmeal at the local Cosi is only served until 11 a.m., but management was generous enough to whip up an afternoon batch for us. The oatmeal is made from steel-cut oats and is pre-sweetened with brown sugar. There is no need to opt for more brown sugar as the oatmeal is just sweet enough, with a smooth consistency. One word of advice is to skip the Cost Break Bar Bits, which can really rack up the calories (one whole bar has 359 calories, though we're not sure how much you get as a topping.) Instead, opt for the dried fruit, fresh fruit, nuts or a touch of granola. McDonalds' Fruit & Maple Oatmeal Rating: 3.5   Cost: $2.29 plus tax   Nutrition Info Per Serving (9.2 ounces): 190 calories; 2.5 grams fat; 14 grams sugar; 3 grams fiber Options: All included with order: diced apples (10 calories, 2 grams sugar), cranberry raisin blend (70 calories, 15 grams sugar), light cream (20 calories, 2 grams sugar) Our Take: We were impressed from a food safety standpoint as the server excused himself before preparing the oatmeal to wash his hands thoroughly (points earned right there.)  He combined dried instant oatmeal (made from whole-grain oats) with hot water, brown sugar and a small amount of cream. The included topping is a  blend of apples, cranberries and raisins. You can also opt for plain oatmeal, but need to say so when you order. The oatmeal had a good consistency with a good mix of flavors and textures, but it was a bit too sweet. Jamba Juice's Steel Cut Oatmeal: Berry Cherry Pecan Rating: 3.5   Cost: $2.95 plus tax   Nutrition Info Per Serving: 340 calories; 9 grams fat; 27 grams sugar; 9 grams fiber Options: Various options available, including Apple Cinnamon, Berry Cherry Pecan, Blueberry & Blackberry, Fresh Banana and Plain with Brown Sugar Topping. Our Take: These steel-cut oats are mixed with soy milk and come with the topping of your choice. Upon inquiring about some of the options, we asked if the blueberries and blackberries were fresh and were told they weren’t — they’re packed in syrup (which usually means more sugar and calories.) We opted for the Berry Cherry Pecan, which promised dried cherries, berries and pecans, but was unexpectedly sweet and salty with candied (meaning higher-calorie) nuts. Taste and flavor of the oatmeal was great, it’s steel-cut, which we love; the texture was both chewy and creamy, as it should be. If you decide to pick up oatmeal at Jamba Juice, opt for the plain with brown sugar or fresh banana. TELL US: What’s your favorite fast-food oatmeal?

Food,Lactose Intolerance 101,"Does drinking milk and chowing down on pizza mean an upset stomach for the rest of the day? Lactose intolerance is one of those conditions you hear about and think you may have, but aren’t 100% sure. Many who have lactose intolerance think that avoiding all milk and dairy is the answer, but the research shows that might not be the case. Here's the deal behind lactose intolerance and how you can include milk and dairy in a lactose intolerant-friendly diet without feeling super uncomfortable. What Is Lactose Intolerance? Lactose intolerance is when your gastrointestinal tract has symptoms like pain, gas or diarrhea after taking in more lactose than your body can digest at that time. Usually the body breaks down lactose into its two parts called glucose and galactose, but if your body can’t get to it (because you had more than your body can handle) then that lactose goes through your digestive system undigested — which leads to all those uncomfortable symptoms. An estimated 30-50 million Americans identify as being lactose intolerant. It is rare in children and usually begins to show up in adolescence or adulthood. Both men and women can be affected equally. It’s prevalent in an estimated 19.5% of African Americans, 10% of Hispanic Americans and 8% of European Americans. The good news is with simple management strategies, those with lactose intolerance can enjoy milk and milk products. How Do I Know I'm Lactose Intolerant? Self-diagnosing lactose intolerance and then cutting out all the dairy isn’t the smartest way to go. Milk and dairy provide nine essential nutrients including several that the 2015-2020 dietary guidelines identified as being under-consumed by Americans including calcium and vitamin D. In addition, research shows that those who do keep cow’s milk dairy in their diet have a better diet quality and take in more essential nutrients. Milk and dairy are associated with a lower risk of osteoporosis (weakened and brittle bones) later in life, a lower risk of high blood pressure and a lower risk of colon cancer. There are two tests to identify lactose intolerance. The first is the lactose tolerance test where you drink a lactose-filled beverage and blood is drawn to see if your body is breaking it down. The second is a hydrogen breath test where, again, you drink a lactose-filled beverage and then breathe into a tube to check if your body is breaking it down. Once you get diagnosed, then you can figure out how to manage your diet better! I'm Lactose Intolerant. Now What? An expert panel from the National Institute of Health and the National Medical Association recommends that those with lactose intolerance keep milk and dairy in their diet. Research shows that those with lactose intolerance can build up enough tolerance to be able to handle 12 grams of lactose, which is the amount found in 1 cup of milk. That doesn’t mean that you should go home and down a glass right now, but over time you can build up your tolerance so your body can handle it. If you're going to build up a tolerance to lactose, starting with lower lactose foods is important. Milk has 12 grams of lactose, but a 1/2 cup of Greek yogurt only has 4 grams, 1 ounce of Swiss, cheddar or mozzarella has less than 0.1 grams and a 1/2 cup of cottage cheese has 3 grams. Both Greek and traditional yogurt have live, active cultures that help breakdown the lactose, and many people are able to handle those better. Some folks with lactose intolerance seem to do better on A2 milk. This milk is made from beta-casein protein A2 and is free from beta-casein protein A1 (other milks have both A1 and A2 protein in them). Other tricks for taking in milk and dairy with lactose intolerance include: • Combining milk and dairy with other foods: This helps slow digestion so your body can better handle the lactose. For example, make a smoothie with Greek yogurt, fruit and peanut butter or sprinkle some cheese over your cooked vegetables. • Using lactase pills or drops: Lactase is the enzyme that helps digest the lactose sugar. You can take a pill or use droplets in your beverages to help with digestion. Read the instructions as the lead time from taking the pill to eating dairy varies between brands. • Increase milk and dairy slowly: Don’t expect to go from eating no dairy to eating one cup a day. Build your tolerance up slowly over weeks or even months. What About Other Foods and “Milks?” If you think you can get the calcium you need from other foods, it’s not as easy as it sounds. For example, you would need to eat more than 10 cups of raw spinach to get the same amount of calcium in 1 cup of milk. So really, cow’s milk is a concentrated source of 9 essential nutrients that are tough to get from other sources. The closest food item, in terms of nutrition, is soy milk or soy products. The 2015-2020 dietary guidelines include soy milk in the milk and dairy category. Other milks just don’t come close nutritionally to cow’s milk – in protein, calcium and other nutrients – to be counted as a serving of dairy, but you can still enjoy them. Bottom Line If you think you have lactose intolerance, get tested first! Once you are diagnosed with lactose intolerance, you can then manage it using a variety of tips which do include keeping the deliciousness of dairy in your diet. *Disclosure: I have worked as an ambassador with the National Dairy Council for about 8 years.

Food,8 Health Goals to Make Now,"Why wait till January to change your health for the better? You can implement small changes now that will result in good-for-you results (including more energy for healthy eating and exercise!) by the new year. We chatted with top health and nutrition experts for ideas.  1: Move more. You don’t have to spend hours a day at the gym to get the benefits of exercise—simply resolve to add in a little extra movement daily. Aim for 20 minutes or more, advises Lyssie Lakatos, RDN, CFT, a dietitian and personal trainer in New York City.  “Movement will get blood flowing and release mood-boosting endorphins,” she says. Try this idea to get started: “Walk for 20 minutes a day, even if it just means that you’ll be stepping out your front door and walking briskly for 10 minutes before turning back,” says Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, CFT, co-creator of the 21-Day Body Reboot. “And if you feel you can exercise for longer, go for it!” 2: Make your next dentist appointment now. Take a second to pick up the phone and schedule your next dental cleaning. “I despise going to the dentist, so I’m going to schedule my regular dentist appointment now and not cancel the day before,” says Jennifer Bowers, PhD, RD, a dietitian in Tucson, AZ. “Dental health is critical, and we only get one set of teeth in our lifetime. Routine dental care not only keeps your teeth and gums healthy, but helps prevent more serious dental issues later.” Have a doctor’s appointment you’ve been dreading to make, too? Go ahead and get it on the books. 3: Eat more veggies. “Have a mixed green salad with dinner, or order one as an appetizer when you dine out,” says Keri Gans, RD, a dietitian and certified yoga teacher in New York City. “Veggies are packed with vitamins, minerals, and fiber — and eating them before an entree can help fill you up so you are less likely to overeat.” Eating a family-style meal? Fill half your plate with vegetables. 4: Adopt Meatless Monday. Add more plant-based dishes to your meal rotation. “Cutting back on meat consumption and going vegetarian at least one day a week can improve your health,” says Sonali Ruder, DO, a physician in the emergency department at Coral Springs Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale, FL. “Eating more nutrient-dense foods like whole grains, vegetables, beans, lentils, and vegetables will increase your intake of essential vitamins and minerals and can help prevent chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.” 5: Score more shut-eye. “Sleep deprivation may lead you to make unhealthy food choices and be less likely to exercise,” says Gans. “Adequate sleep can help make all your other goals a little easier to reach."" Aim to get to bed an hour earlier, and create a wind-down routine to help you fall asleep faster. “Turning your cellphone on silent, drinking chamomile tea, and taking a hot bath are all good ways of winding your body down to promote better sleep,” says Ani Baran, L.Ac, an acupuncturist in Jersey City, NJ. 6: Cook at home more. If your go-to easy dinner involves the neighborhood Italian restaurant or Seamless.com several times a week, swap a few of those meals for home-cooked ones. Stock your kitchen with quick-prep ingredients, such as  microwaveable brown rice, canned beans, and fresh and frozen veggies. “Research shows that people who cook most of their meals at home consume fewer carbohydrates, less sugar, and less fat than those who cook less or not at all,” says Angie Asche, MS, RD, owner of Eleat Sports Nutrition in Lincoln, NE. “And cooking at home allows you to be aware of how much sodium, fat, and sugar you are adding to your meals—as well as control the portion size!” 7: Start a windowsill garden. Take a drive to the hardware store this weekend to pick up what you need — or ask for some starter seeds as a stocking stuffer. ""If you want to see both mental and physical benefits from adopting just one simple hobby this year, consider planting a small herb garden to sit on your windowsill,” suggests Emily Kyle, MS, RDN, owner of Emily Kyle Nutrition in Rochester, NY. “Research shows that tending to a plant, like a small herb garden, can help reduce stress and anxiety by creating a new appreciation for nature.” Plus, with produce at your fingertips, you’ll have an easier time reaching that goal to eat more veggies. 8: Practice positivity. “People who practice positivity and thankfulness have better immune systems and are able to reduce the stress that often makes health conditions worse,” says Baran. Do something nice for your partner, colleague, or friend today to spread the positivity. Amy Gorin, MS, RDN, is a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Amy Gorin Nutrition in Jersey City, NJ. She’s a regular contributor to many publications, including EverydayHealth.com, NBCNews.com, Runner’s World, and more—as well as WeightWatchers.com, where she was a longtime editor.

Food,5 Snacks to Fight Off Hunger,"For me, snacking is a must! It helps me get from one meal to the next -- no headaches, drops in energy or stomach rumbling. My secret: choosing snacks that contain hunger-fighting ingredients. Here are five favorites. Snacking Basics Snacks aren't bad. In fact, they are “mini meals” that are meant to curb hunger and help supplement nutrients you may not be getting enough of from meals (like fiber from fruits and veggies). Studies show that waiting too long to eat between meals can cause you to overeat later in the day -- not exactly the best way to lose weight or stay healthy. Stick to snacks that are between 100 and 200 calories each. You especially need them when you have three to five hours between meals. My snack breaks often fall at 10:30am and 2:30pm -- about one and a half to two hours between my meals. 1) Peanut Butter and Whole-Wheat Crackers Combine lean protein, fiber and healthy fat and you’ve got a satisfying snack. Protein and fiber work for cutting down and controlling hunger, while fat takes a bit longer to digest and keeps you feeling full longer. Peanut butter is high in healthy monounsaturated fats, but be sure to portion out one tablespoon to keep calories in check. Portion: 1 tablespoon natural peanut butter and 4 whole-wheat crackers Total: 180 calories, 5 grams of protein   2) Vegetable Soup Don't eat enough veggies? Try snacking on a warm, hearty vegetable soup --- 20 minutes later you’ll feel like a new person. Vegetables contain fiber, which helps you feel full and also helps stabilize blood sugar throughout the day -- meaning no gnawing hunger pains. Try a minestrone or bean soup for additional protein. If you're feeling extra hungry at snack time, add one or two whole-wheat breadsticks or a small whole-wheat roll. Portion: 1 cup vegetable soup   Total: 100 calories, 4 grams protein   3) Low-Fat Cottage Cheese and Fruit With its good balance of protein, carbs and fat, cottage cheese is one of the most underappreciated foods. Add fiber with fresh fruit, such as berries, melon, pears or pineapple, for a perfect snack. A 1/2-cup serving contains 7% of your daily calcium needs, which is important for healthy bones. Portion: 1/2 cup low-fat or nonfat cottage cheese with 1/2 cup sliced or 1 medium piece of fresh fruit Total calories: 140 calories, 14 grams protein   4) Hummus with Sliced Veggies This Middle Eastern chickpea spread is packed with protein, fiber and heart-healthy unsaturated fats. Veggies like carrots, bell peppers and broccoli make great dippers and add good nutrients, including beta-carotene, vitamin C and, of course, more belly-filling fiber. Two tablespoons of plain hummus has 50 calories and 3 grams of fat, so you’re probably better off measuring out two to three tablespoons instead of sitting down with the entire container. Portion: 3 tablespoons of plain hummus plus 1 cup of sliced veggies Total calories: 120 calories, 7 grams protein   5) Trail Mix Almonds, cashews, walnuts, peanuts or pecans are full of healthy fat, fiber and protein. A delicious homemade trail mix is simple: Portion out a handful of nuts and mix in two tablespoons of dried fruit like raisins, cranberries or apricots. To minimize calories, choose nuts that are dry roasted or raw. For a change of pace, throw in whole-wheat pretzels or some of your favorite cereal (I’ve been on a Puffins kick lately). Packing your trail mix in plastic bags or containers makes it easy to grab and go. If you find yourself plowing through your snack mix, try using shelled nuts that will take longer to eat. Portion: 15 nuts plus 2 tablespoons of dried fruit Total calories: 170 calories, 7 grams protein  ",620
