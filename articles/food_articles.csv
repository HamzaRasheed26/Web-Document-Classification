Food,How to Eat Healthy When Your Partner Doesn't Want To,https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/healthy-tips/how-to-eat-healthy-when-partner-doesnt,"The people you’re surrounded by can play a significant role in your food choices. This is especially the case with your significant other, because you’re likely sharing lots of meal times together. If your eating habits don’t align, you may end up cooking completely different meals or ordering out from different places. Something meant to be fun, like going out for brunch, can start to become stressful if your partner isn’t open to your new ways of eating. I’ve had many clients who are motivated to eat healthier and have tried everything to get their partners onboard. Oftentimes, this can result in tension or arguments if there isn’t open communication about where the other person is coming from. Here are some strategies that I’ve used in my nutrition practice that may be helpful for navigating this with your partner. Being Pushy Usually Doesn’t Work. You are your own person, and it’s OK to not want to do the same things as your partner, even if you think it’s good for them. When we get close to someone, it can be really exciting to share activities together, including cooking and going out to eat. We can still do these things while creating and honoring boundaries. There could be a number of reasons your partner doesn’t want to get onboard with how you’re eating. This doesn’t mean that they don’t care about their health or don’t want to support you in making changes. Whether or not you agree with their reasoning, you should respect where they’re at without judgment. In my experience, making lifestyle changes to please someone else is usually short-lived, because the person doing these changes doesn’t have that intrinsic motivation. Making your partner feel bad because they’re not eating vegetables or exercising regularly will likely not result in long-term change. Focus on You. Making lasting lifestyle changes is hard enough, so instead of putting energy into getting someone else on board, redirect that energy back into yourself. You’ll save yourself a lot of stress and frustration, and you can use this as an opportunity to explore your food needs a little deeper. What foods do you enjoy eating? Which eating patterns help you feel your best? Are there foods considered “healthy” that you actually don’t like? These questions are a great way to explore your unique sweet spot that honors pleasure and nutrition. Instead of focusing on what you (or others) should be eating, you’ll be able to develop a deeper understanding of what makes you feel your best. Enjoy Food Differently but Together. Eating different meals doesn’t mean you can’t bond over food. You can still go food shopping together, taking into account each of your preferences and dislikes. Cooking can be a great opportunity to spend time together and foster gratitude for the food you’re eating. If this is something you’re both into, you can set aside time each week to cook up a good meal in the kitchen. Similarly, if ordering out is your thing, you can both look up places that offer food options for the both of you.

Food,"Up, Up and Away! Pack These Nutrition Tips Next Time You Fly",https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/healthy-tips/2014/11/up-up-and-away-pack-these-nutrition-tips-next-time-you-fly,"Whether you're traveling home for the holidays, getting away on vacation, or are a frequent flyer, air travel presents a common challenge to healthy eating. Understanding the unique needs of your body in flight, along with a little bit of planning, can go a long way in getting you to your destination energized, not exhausted. Arrive at the Airport Well Fed Start your trip on the right foot by eating a nutritious meal before you head out to the airport. Even if you're a last-minute packer, you can whip up something quick, and by eating a satisfying meal before leaving home, you can minimize the number of eating decisions you need to make while traveling.     • Breakfast Burrito     • Yogurt-Berry Parfait     • Veggie Stack Pita Pockets     • Kale and Apple Salad  Bring Portable, Non-Perishable Nutritious Snacks Most people eat every three to five hours, so if you're flying during the day, odds are you're flying during a meal time. If you can find a nutritious option at the airport to bring on your flight, such as a salad, great. But many times you're dealing with limited options – most of which are not that healthy – so packing a mini-meal or snack can be a great backup. When crafting a suitable snack, consider eating foods rich in antioxidants, which may help you avoid getting sick (remember the recycled air and the sneezing person behind you). Additionally, if you're trying to get some shut-eye, certain options may be more effective in promoting a relaxed state – foods with complex carbs, calcium, vitamin B6, tryptophan and more.     Here are a few portable snacks to consider that fill the bill:   • Trail mix including almonds, walnuts or pistachios, like this Goji Berry Trail Mix     • Fresh berries with yogurt or a piece of string cheese       • Hummus and pretzels or red/orange bell pepper slices       • Any salad including dark, leafy greens (one can dream!)       • Homemade Granola Bars or Fig and Walnut Bars      • Smoky Kale Chips      • Cucumber and Tomato Sandwich with Garlic White Bean Hummus Drink the Right Fluids The stress of flying makes staying hydrated equally important – and many people are boarding the plane already dehydrated. Consider your average trip to the airport: After you leave the house, when is the next time you have a drink? To ensure that you fly, and land, well hydrated: • Bring an empty water bottle through airport security. • Drink a full bottle of water (16 to 20 fluid ounces) before getting on board. • Drink one bottle of water at least every two to three hours while flying (and not sleeping). If you're on a red-eye and trying to get some sleep, chamomile and passion fruit teas may be helpful in calming you. Bring the tea bag from home and ask for hot water while flying. While tart cherry juice would be another great option – as it has been shown to be beneficial with melatonin production and antioxidants – it may be difficult to get while traveling. Two drink ingredients to watch out for: alcohol and caffeine. Any amount of alcohol is dehydrating and increases stress on your body, so avoid it if you can. Caffeine intake should be minimized if you’re trying to sleep, and excessive amounts may stress the body as well. Two Last Considerations Two other ways you can help your body deal with the stresses of flying involve exercise and sleep: • While consistent physical activity generally keeps your immune system strong, you may not want to perform exhaustive exercise (think high-intensity intervals, half Ironmans, etc.) within 12 hours before flying, as your immune system may be compromised following an intensely stressful bout of activity. • Get a good night's sleep before a morning flight, and try to take at least one power nap (30 to 45 minutes) during a red-eye if you can't get comfortable for a longer rest.

Food,The Chef's Take: Grains and Egg Bowl from Camille Becerra,https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/restaurants/2014/09/the-chefs-take-grains-and-egg-bowl-from-camille-becerra,"Here's something you may not know about Camille Becerra, chef at the stylish New American seafood restaurant, Navy, in New York City's SoHo. Becerra studied macrobiotic cooking, prepared meals to heal cancer patients in Philadelphia and lived at a Zen monastery in New Mexico where she cooked vegetarian meals for the monks, sourcing ingredients from the on-premises garden. ""Through macrobiotic cooking, I saw the importance of food as a source of health,"" she says. ""I am always very interested in how food can heal and prevent illness."" At Navy, Becerra offers a menu that caters to locavore hipsters, with seasonal plates like black bass crudo with rhubarb and pine nuts, tilefish with tomato, avocado and almonds, and soft-shell crab with squash-blossom pancakes. But she's also partial to her macrobiotic roots. For the lunch menu, Becerra added this bowl of grains and eggs with an eye toward offering guests a midday meal that would energize. ""During the day, you don't want something super-rich that will potentially slow you down,"" she says. ""For the lunch menu, I focused on lighter dishes with lots of vegetables and superfoods."" The grains bowl is the perfect example of this philosophy at work. She uses a combination of assorted super grains -- red rice, quinoa, farro, wheatberries and brown rice -- and tosses them with fresh herbs. The grains are spooned over some sumac yogurt, then topped off with avocado, carrots, beets and root vegetables -- whatever's in season. A poached egg, some pickled shallots and lightly dressed greens crown the dish. Says Becerra: ""It’s good for you, it's full of flavor and it gives you the fuel you need for your day.""  Grains and Egg Bowl This isn't so much a recipe as a general formula: The beauty of this dish is its versatility. So use any cooked grains you have on hand and whatever vegetables are in season. Add some yogurt, greens and an egg on top, and you are all set.  Here's how Becerra says she proceeds:     I. Whole Grains   A mix of 2 or 3 types of cooked grains is lovely, for example; farro, red/brown/black rice, quinoa, wheatberries.     II. Roasted Vegetables   A mix also works very well, and I especially love the sweetness that root vegetables and squashes bring to the egg bowl, for example; carrots, beets, parsnips, butternut squash.     III. Savory Yogurt   Something magical happens when you mix sea salt and yogurt. With the addition of mild spices or herbs, you can create your own savory yogurt, for example: dill, dandelion, parsley, ground fennel or coriander seed. I always like to add a drop of honey or agave to balance the tartness of the yogurt. I am currently obsessed with sumac yogurt.     Sumac Yogurt       1 cup Greek (strained) yogurt       2 pinches sumac       1 pinch sea salt       ¼  teaspoon agave       IV. Fresh Greens and Herbs   Generally, I like to use watercress for its spicy bite and a mix of sliced scallions, chives and parsley. There are so many options for this fresh element to the egg bowl. Toss them slightly in olive oil, sea salt and a drop or two of lemon juice.     V. The Egg   At Navy, we serve the egg bowl with a poached egg, but a fried egg is also so wonderful. A pinch of chili powder atop of the egg is key. Finally, drizzle it all with some fruity olive oil and sea salt. A real pleaser for breakfast, lunch or dinner.

Food,Is Sweet Potato Toast the New Avocado Toast?,https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/2017/02/is-sweet-potato-toast-the-new-avocado-toast,"Thanks to the social mediasphere, sweet potato toast has emerged as one of the biggest food fads of the last several months. The concept of simply toasting a sliced sweet potato intrigued me, so I had to check out what the frenzy is all about. While I wouldn’t say sweet potato toast resembles toasted bread, it is an easy and delicious way to add more vegetables to your day, especially if you love sweet potatoes like I do. Plus, that vibrant color is sure to bring joy to mealtime. Here is what you need to know about sweet potato toast. Nutritional benefits of sweet potatoes Beta-carotene, the nutrient that the body converts into vitamin A, reigns as the nutritional crown jewel of sweet potatoes, providing more than 230% of the daily value in just one small tater. For the sake of this post, I’m using one small, 60-gram sweet potato, which is closest to the weight of a slice of bread that weighs in at 43 grams. What’s better for you: sweet potato toast or whole-wheat toast? Sweet potatoes count as a vegetable, and whole-wheat toast provides you with a serving of whole grains. Therefore, we’re not comparing apples to apples. Your body benefits from both whole grains and vegetables, since they provide different ranges of nutrients. Perhaps the most significant nutritional differences between sweet potato toast and wheat toast show up in the form of calories and certain vitamins. One small sweet potato contains half the calories as a piece of toast. Vitamins A and C don’t even register on the charts for bread, while sweet potatoes offer a good source of vitamin C and some potassium. One small sweet potato contains 12 grams carbs with 2 grams fiber, whereas a slice of store-bought 100% whole-wheat bread provides 19 grams carbs and 3 g fiber. A significant difference? Not really. The total grams of sugar only varies by 1 gram, however the kind in bread is added sugar totaling 3/4 teaspoon, like from honey, white sugar, molasses or high fructose corn syrup. The sugar in sweet potatoes is naturally occurring inside the sweet potato. A slice of bread contains 160 milligrams sodium, whereas a sweet potato contains only 22 milligrams—a nice feature. However that difference is miniscule if you regularly eat fast food, canned soup and frozen meals, which top the charts in sodium contents. In defense of bread, though, whole grains are an excellent source of disease-fighting vitamins and minerals like manganese, selenium, magnesium and thiamin, generally beating sweet potatoes by strong margins for these nutrients. For you protein seekers, whole-wheat bread contains 4 grams, whereas a sweet potato only contains 1 gram. How to make sweet potato toast Some methods utilize a toaster, but the Food NetworkTest Kitchen found that the toasts stay together better when the taters are sliced and cooked in the oven. Follow the directions in our recipes for Sweet Potato Toast with Ricotta, Berries, Honey and Almonds or Bacon, Egg and Cheese on Sweet Potato Toast, and make a batch of the toasts that can be stored and easily reheated for up to 4 days (a great timesaver for busy weekday mornings!). What to put on sweet potato toast A variety of toppings pair well with sweet potato toast. I love to mash on avocado slices, creating sweet potato avocado toast—a double threat. Boost flavor with flaked sea salt, ground cumin or chili powder. Other favorites include hummus or pulled pork sprinkled with pomegranate arils. Or turn your chips and salsa ritual into sweet potato and salsa bruschetta. If you have a toaster oven, sprinkle feta, pecans and smoked paprika on top for a drool-worthy meal or appetizer. I also make sweet potato toast as a simple side dish to enjoy alongside dishes missing a vegetable or carb, like soup or salad. The bottom line Sweet potato toast and 100% whole-grain toast are both good for you. Most importantly they’re delicious. Rotate them in your meals for the widest range of beneficial nutrients.

Food,Are You a Healthy Snacker?,https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/2017/09/are-you-a-healthy-snacker,"We have become a snacking nation, but that doesn’t mean everyone snacks healthfully. Snacking on high calorie foods with few nutrients can lead to weight gain and unhealthy eating habits. And mindlessly munching on a bag of chips (yes, even veggie chips!) in front of the TV at night is not a healthy habit either. So how can you tell if you’re a healthy snacker? See how you answer the following 5 questions. 1. Are you having a snack or a treat? A snack is a mini meal that provides nutrients you may not be getting enough of during regular meals, such as fiber, calcium, vitamin D and potassium. A treat is a food that provides very little (if any) nutrition, but contains a lot of calories such as a doughnut or bag of potato chips. To become a healthy snacker: Think before eating. If it’s a snack, then enjoy it! If it’s a treat, ask yourself if you really need it and if not, swap it for a healthier choice. 2.Do you really need the snack? Snacks shouldn’t be eaten just for the sake of having something in your mouth or to alleviate boredom. They should be eaten if you are truly hungry, like if you go five or more hours between meals without food (not counting sleep time). To become a healthy snacker: Pre-plan snack times one to two times per day when you find yourself the hungriest 3. Are you carb-overloading? Although whole grain pretzels or crackers sound like a healthy snack, they’re more satisfying when combined with a protein or healthy fat which helps slow down digestion and keep you satisfied for longer. To become a healthy snacker: Combine carbs with protein or healthy fat such as Greek yogurt topped with berries, or whole grain crackers topped with peanut butter. 4. Are you controlling your portions? Having the right foods and the right time is important, but you also need to eat these foods in appropriate portions. Some foods are very healthy, but when eaten in large quantities can add hundreds of unnecessary calories to your day. To become a healthy snacker: Aim to have snacks between 125 to 200 calories each. Review the nutrition facts panel of packaged foods for recommended serving sizes and calories per serving. 5. Are you a packaged food snacker? Many packaged foods aren’t as healthy as they seem. Some may contain few calories…but few vitamins and minerals too. Other can be laden with artery clogging fat and loads of calories. To become a healthy snacker: Control the ingredients by preparing a few snacks at home.

Food,Taste Test: Frozen Macaroni and Cheese,https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/2014/10/taste-test-frozen-macaroni-and-cheese,"Are you falling for claims that many brands of frozen macaroni and cheese are reasonable options for a healthy dinner? Check out the results of this evaluation before your next trip down the freezer aisle. The Criteria We used our typical rating scale of 1 to 5 (5 being the highest) for this taste test. Each brand was evaluated based on taste and nutrition, paying special attention to calories, fat, sodium and ingredient quality. Many of the brands had both conventional oven and microwave instructions; we prepared all of them in the microwave for consistency. Weight Watcher's Smart Ones – Three Cheese Macaroni Rating: 1   Cost: $2.49 per (9-ounce) serving   Nutrition Info: 300 calories; 6 grams of fat (2.5 grams saturated); 570 milligrams sodium The Healthy Eats Take: This low-cal version of mac and cheese features firm pasta in a watery, yellow-ish, salty tasting sauce. It also has long list of ingredients with trans fats and plenty of thickeners and stabilizers – including carrageenan, cornstarch and gelatin. Stouffer’s Macaroni and Cheese Rating: 2   Cost: $4.79 per (20-ounce) container ($1.90 per 8-ounces) Nutrition Info: 320 calories; 15 grams of fat (6 grams saturated); 830 milligrams sodium The Healthy Eats Take: This brand has a distinctive mac and cheese flavor but a thick, gummy sauce and overly mushy pasta. It’s highest in sodium, with a whopping 35% of the daily recommendation in just 1 cup. It also contains partially hydrogenated oils (aka trans fats). Mom Made Meals -- Cheesy Mac Rating: 4   Cost: $4.59 per (7-ounce) serving   Nutrition Info: 230 calories; 7 grams of fat (4.5 grams saturated); 370 milligrams sodium The Healthy Eats Take: This version is made with organic ingredients including a few extra servings of veggies. It has a slightly chalky aftertaste but just the right amount of seasoning. Organic sweet potatoes and butternut squash outweigh powdered cheese and the addition of green peas along with the pasta is a nice touch. Blake's Old Fashioned Mac & Cheese Rating: 4   Cost: $3.99 per (8-ounce) serving   Nutrition Info: 370 calories; 18 grams of fat (5 grams saturated); 480 milligrams sodium The Healthy Eats Take: Complete with a crispy topping, this pasta entree has a pleasant blend of white cheeses and a creamy texture. It's highest in total fat but contains less saturated fat than many of the others (with some coming from palm oil). The cheese sauce is thickened with flour, cornstarch and whole milk. Amy's Macaroni & Cheese Rating: 4.5   Cost: $3.79 per (9-ounce) serving   Nutrition Info: 400 calories; 16 grams of fat (10 grams saturated); 640 milligrams sodium The Healthy Eats Take: Very appealing looking and super tasty! This creamy pasta was full of flavor (my kids asked for seconds of this one). It was a little over dressed with sauce but the pasta maintained a nice texture. Made with organic pasta and milk, additional ingredients were cheddar cheese, butter, rice flour and sea salt. It did lose some credit for being so high in sodium.

Food,Tips for Feeding Healthy and Happy Kids: An Interview with Ellyn Satter,https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/2012/06/tips-for-feeding-healthy-and-happy-kids-an-interview-with-ellyn-satter," If the struggle to get your kids to eat right is driving you nuts, there’s hope! We asked registered dietitian and (my all-time-favorite) child nutrition expert Ellyn Satter to weigh in. Q: Why do so many parents have trouble feeding their kids? A: Because they care so much. Parents have been brainwashed about what is good and bad nutrition-wise and feel pressured to produce a healthy child. The most important thing is the family meal. The parents’ job is to help preserve a positive attitude about eating.  It almost doesn’t matter what you’re eating as long as it’s together. Once parents can establish structure and rhythm to getting meals on the table, creativity will start to kick in and deciding what to serve gets easier. Q: When it comes to feeding kids, what’s the biggest mistake parents make? A: Parents often provide too little support and too much interference – insisting and bribery don’t work. You can’t fool a child. Parents need to trust that the child will learn to make smart decisions when it comes to what they eat. Q: What are your top 3 tips to help parents deal with picky eaters? Understand normal eating patterns. Children are naturally erratic, one day they’ll appear to love a particular food, another day they’ll treat it like poison. It takes a number of exposures for children to decide if they truly like a food. Fifteen to twenty is a popular figure, but it really may be 40 to 80 exposures.Don’t limit the menu to foods the child readily accepts. It gives them too much power. There’s nothing wrong with adjusting the meal to accommodate their abilities. For example, when serving spaghetti with meat sauce present it on the plate with the pasta, meat sauce and Parmesan cheese in separate piles to make eating it easier.Trust the child to grow into learning how to eat. Q: How do you feel about parents sneaking fruits and veggies into kids’ meals? A: Inclusion of a wide variety of foods in recipes a good thing but I don't agree with ""sneaking."" They’ll catch on and not trust you. Parents also need to lead by example: For a kid to like broccoli, someone else in the family has to eat broccoli. Q: How does the childhood obesity epidemic factor into to your philosophy? A: It’s all about the division of responsibility. The parent takes care of the what, where and when, and then trusts the child to eat and grow how nature intended. If parents push certain foods, amounts of food, or tries to restrict the amount of food children are allowed to have it can make them food preoccupied and prone to overeat. We asked Ellyn to share a recipe with us. We excitedly dug into her book Secrets of Feeding a Healthy Family and chose this easy and deliciously simple chicken dish. Ellyn recommends serving it with roasted broccoli, rice, ciabatta bread, butter, seasonal fruit and milk. Yum! Pesto-Parmesan Chicken 6 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, about 1 ½ pounds 1 ½ cups grated Parmesan, Romano, or Asiago Cheese, about 6 ounces 6 tablespoons pesto Preheat oven to 425-degrees F. Mix 2 tablespoons grated cheese with pesto. Rub or pat pesto mixture onto chicken breast until you have a light, even coating. Sprinkle the remaining cheese onto a plate. Press both sides of the chicken into the cheese to form a coating. You will probably need to refresh your plate of grated cheese several times. Be careful that you do not contaminate your container of cheese by handling it after you have handled the raw chicken. Place chicken into a 10x6-inch baking dish. Bake for 25 minutes to an internal temperature of 165-degrees F. Tell Us: What's your biggest struggle when it comes to feeding your family?  ",634
Food,Blogger Spotlight: Kate Taylor from Cookie and Kate ,https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/2012/08/blogger-spotlight-kate-taylor-from-cookie-and-kate,"Kate is a self-taught photographer and cook from Oklahoma whose passion for food inspires readers to step into the kitchen and start cooking. With a focus on whole food, the recipes she shares on  Cookie and Kate are both nutritious and fun to make. She believes in keeping food as close to its source as possible and features exclusively vegetarian fare. Cookie is her friendly canine companion and “chief crumb catcher.” What does “whole food” mean to you and why is it important to you to eat this way? Whole food, to me, basically just means real food that is as close to its source as possible. In other words, whole food is minimally processed and doesn't contain unnecessary junk like preservatives, chemicals or pesticides. Naturally, whole foods are better for us, too. Whole grains retain the nutrients and good fats that processing removes. And fresh, quality ingredients taste better! You can make an incredible meal with just a few great ingredients. That's why I say my blog ""celebrates whole foods,"" because I believe that food should both delight the senses and nourish the body. Whole foods can do that. What made you start your blog, Cookie and Kate? How has it evolved since you started? A couple of years ago, I was stuck in a stifling desk job and decided I needed a creative project. Photography had long been one of my favorite hobbies, but my camera was gathering dust on a shelf. I read a lot of blogs in my free time, so I decided to start one of my own. I picked a name that I thought would be memorable, designed it myself and started posting about a variety of subjects: life, design, etc. Coincidentally, around that time I was developing more of an interest in food and cooking. I had been reading a lot of Michael Pollan, I'd given up meat and started experimenting more in the kitchen. I posted my favorite salsa recipe and got such a nice response that I started posting more and more recipes. Cookie and Kate eventually evolved into a full-fledged food blog, and I couldn't be happier about it. What do you like best about blogging? To me, food blogging is just the greatest creative outlet—it combines my love for cooking, photography, writing and web design. I also enjoy connecting with others over our shared love for food. I've become friends with wonderful people around the world through my blog. It's pretty amazing. What is your favorite cuisine to cook? Oh, this is tough. I generally love spicy, flavorful food that is full of fresh produce and herbs. I'm not sure any of my recipes could be considered authentic cuisine, but I like to cook meals with Mexican, Mediterranean or Asian influences. What is your favorite ingredient to cook with? Lately, I can't get enough coconut. Coconut milk lends creaminess to cooked grains, coconut oil is a great substitute for butter and has the most lovely coconut scent, and coconut flakes add texture and flavor to baked goods. You're a firm believer in allowing yourself occasional indulgences. What do you think is the key to splurging on treats without unraveling a healthy diet? I wish I had an exciting secret to share, but it's really all about moderation. I might go out to lunch with a friend and splurge on a big meal, but then I'll eat a salad for dinner. I prefer quality over quantity and try to eat reasonable portions, too. I've learned that I can actually get more satisfaction out of a single scoop of homemade ice cream than a big milkshake, as long as I savor every bite. Plus, I know I would feel sleepy and sluggish after eating that big milkshake, and I don't like to feel that way. Making good decisions is a lot easier when we are mindful of how different foods make us feel!",652
Food,Market Watch: Pomegranates,https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/in-season/2017/12/in-season-pomegranates,"With the advent of icy weather, the fruit selection at the market begins to look a little ho-hum. But then the festive, red pomegranate arrives on the scene. Encased in its shiny rind are hundreds of juicy, jewel-like seeds — called “arils” by those in the know. One of the oldest known fruits, pomegranates immigrated to California along with Spanish missionaries in the 1700s. Nowadays, the majority of the U.S. crop is grown in the dry San Joaquin valley. Though they’re available starting in late fall, it’s not until December that I finally take notice. Then, I find myself using these sweet-tart seeds to brighten up any number of wintry dishes.  How to Crack ‘Em Tackling a pomegranate takes a bit of know-how. Of course, you can simply split the fruit in half and laboriously tease out the seeds from the bitter, white membranes. But here’s a slightly quicker method: First, slice off the crown end with a sharp knife. Then make a series of shallow, vertical slits down the raised ridges. Break the fruit into sections and bend each section backwards to pop out the seeds. Pomegranate Facts Pomegranates are an excellent source of vitamin C, providing almost half the daily recommended value in a single serving, not to mention healthy amounts of vitamin K, folate, and potassium. They are also one of nature’s best sources of polyphenols, antioxidants that are thought to prevent both heart disease and cancer. At the market, choose shiny, deep red to purplish pomegranates that feel heavy for their size, avoiding those that are cracked or blemished. Uncut, pomegranates will last in the fridge for up to two months. You can refrigerate the seeds for about three days and freeze them up to six months. What to Do with Pomegranates A scattering of pomegranate seeds makes any dish look fancy in a flash. To make a salad fit for the holiday table, combine thinly sliced fennel, endives, and oranges, dress with a lemony vinaigrette, and garnish with fennel fronds and pomegranate seeds. For a quick winter cocktail, you can’t beat champagne or non-alcoholic cider topped with floating pomegranate seeds. You can even incorporate them into a gift for the hostess: Take your favorite chocolate bark recipe and add a shower of pomegranate seeds (press them in to help them adhere). Since the pomegranate originally hails from the Middle East, the seeds are found in many recipes from the region. Try them sprinkled over roasted chicken thighs, glazed with pomegranate molasses (a concentrated form of the juice available in higher-end grocery stores). They also lend their sweetness and crunch to grain salads: Mix them with bulgur or quinoa, toasted walnuts, lots of chopped parsley, and feta cheese. To make a comforting and ultra-healthy hot beverage, simmer pomegranate seeds in water for about 15 minutes. Serve hot, with honey and a strip of orange peel.

Food,Cedar-Plank Cooking,https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/2013/05/cedar-plank-cooking,"    I adore cooking food on a cedar plank. Why? Let me count the ways…   1. Baking on a cedar plank imparts a subtle wood flavor to meat, fish, shellfish, poultry, and vegetables, adding warmth and complexity to any dish. 2. The baking planks are designed for baking in the oven and they last for years (even if they crack, you can place them on a baking sheet to catch any juices). 3. Wooden planks belong in a healthy cook's arsenal because, once seasoned the first time, they retain their moisture and require very little, if any, fat to prevent sticking. 4. Because wooden planks retain moisture, they help maintain the natural juices in meats and vegetables, keeping the food moist as well as flavorful. Depending on where you get them (you can find food-grade cedar planks in the many grocery stores and in the cooking/gourmet section of your favorite kitchen store), baking planks typically come in two different varieties of wood, Western red cedar and alder. Cedar is more aromatic and adds a distinct woodsy flavor while alder is mild and slightly sweet. Before you use your baking plank for the first time, follow the manufacturer's instructions for ""seasoning"". It's a very simple process of oiling the plank with vegetable oil and a paper towel. You only need to oil the plank before the first use – but you can certainly add additional oils to flavor a dish before baking. For example, I seasoned the plank for the salmon below with a simple blend of rice vinegar and good-quality olive oil. The flavors on the plank blend with the wood to infuse flavor from the bottom, while an orange-teriyaki-sesame glaze imparts flavor from the top. It's a truly sensational dish that's simple to prepare yet astonishes a crowd. Trust me. Also, I nestled yellow tomatoes around the salmon because they looked particularly awesome the day I bought the fish. Feel free to use any awesome-looking vegetable you want. Great choices include zucchini, yellow squash, asparagus, bell peppers, corn, broccoli, cauliflower or green beans. *A note about barbecue planks: also designed to impart a woodsy flavor while maintaining moisture in food, these planks are intended for one use only. They also require soaking before using to prevent the wood from burning. Baking planks require no soaking. When using barbecue/grilling planks, be sure to read the manufacturer's instructions. Cedar Plank Teriyaki Salmon With Cherry Tomatoes     1 teaspoon olive oil       1 teaspoon seasoned rice vinegar       1 whole salmon fillet (salmon ""side""), about 1 1/2 pounds       Salt and freshly ground black pepper       16 yellow or red cherry tomatoes       1 tablespoon teriyaki sauce and marinade (such as La Choy)       1 tablespoon orange juice       1/2 teaspoon sesame oil       1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard       1 teaspoon sesame seeds       1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil and rice vinegar. Rub the mixture all over a cedar plank. Arrange the salmon on top of the oil-vinegar coating, skin side down, and season the top with salt and pepper. Arrange the tomatoes around the salmon. In a small bowl, whisk together the teriyaki sauce, orange juice, sesame oil, and Dijon mustard. Brush the mixture all over the top of the salmon. Bake for 15 minutes. Sprinkle the sesame seeds over the salmon and bake for 10 more minutes, until the salmon pulls apart with a fork. Sprinkle the top of the salmon with the cilantro and serve.

Food,What to Do Instead of Health Challenges,https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/healthy-tips/what-to-do-instead-of-health-challenges,"It’s January and like clockwork, wellness challenges are popping up left and right online. The whole “new year, new you” has become so predictable and exhausting, especially after living through the stress of a pandemic. The last thing on my mind is doing squats for 30 days or drinking a smoothie five days a week. These challenges are usually tied to aesthetic or weight goals (i.e. get a six-pack, lose 20 pounds by the summer) and it almost seems like you’re wrong for not having New Year’s resolutions that center on dieting. But what happens when the challenge is over? In my experience, those challenges usually don’t result in consistent habits that are sustained over time because they’re not addressing your basic health needs, like whether you’re eating enough or eating a variety of food groups. As a registered dietitian, I’ve been practicing an intuitive eating approach with clients who want to work on their relationship with food and health. I’ve seen the negative impacts of dieting, restriction and intentional weight loss. And whether you’re completely cutting out food groups or you have more subtle rules around food and exercise, the restriction mentality can get in the way of helping you develop an enjoyable and pleasurable relationship with food. Also, lifestyle changes that you do consistently, independent of weight loss, are a much better predictor of overall good health. If you’re interested in practicing healthier habits, here are some things that beat doing a challenge. Redefine health on your own terms. Oftentimes our definition of health is tied up with other people’s habits and physical traits. You have your own unique needs, and it’s helpful to take a pause and think about what types of foods and movements work best for you. It’s OK if running on a treadmill or eating chard isn’t your thing. There are so many ways to move and eat — go with what aligns with your preferences, health needs and culture. Cutting out certain foods in the name of health is unnecessary (unless there’s a medical reason) and you may actually find that when you categorize certain foods as off-limits, you end up craving those foods even more. Finding a middle ground between nutrition, movement and pleasure is a much more sustainable way to build habits that last, which leads me to my next point. Create habits that are sustainable long-term. A new year rolls around, you’ve created a long list of goals and then a few months later, you barely even remember what those goals were — sound familiar? I’ve seen this happen over and over again with my clients, mainly because they overcommitted to goals that were not realistic long-term. When thinking about what health looks like for you, consider all the things you already have going on and ask yourself if engaging in these new habits is going to make life really hard. If doing some of these things is stressful or feels like a burden, then it’s time to reconsider whether it’s a habit that makes sense. Remember: Small and steady wins the race. I know drastic changes — like doing a 60-day challenge or cutting out food groups — sound sexier than drinking more water or adding a variety of vegetables to your meals, but in my experience, it’s the small habits (done over time) that lead to big gains. Overhauling your life in the name of wellness can oftentimes lead to feelings of defeat and hopelessness. Wellness is for everyone and only you get to decide what that looks like for you.

Food,5 Things You Need to Know Before Going Keto,https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/diets/keto-for-beginners,"The keto diet trend shows no signs of slowing down. If you’ve decided to give it a shot, there are some key things to know from the start to help you get the best results. What Is Keto? The keto or ketogenic diet is designed to put your body into ketosis. Nutritional ketosis is a metabolic state in which the body creates ketones, and burns ketones and fat instead of glucose from carbohydrates. “The focus of the ketogenic diet is consuming lots of healthy fats, which provide the body with energy, while at the same time drastically reducing your carb intake,” says Dr. Josh Axe, D.N.M., C.N.S., D.C., author of Keto Diet. “Unlike some other weight loss diets, the diet isn’t focused on calorie restriction, or on consuming lots of protein in place of carbohydrates.” Along with weight loss, the keto diet, which was used originally to treat epilepsy in children, is touted for boosting brain health and curbing sugar cravings, among other benefits. More research is still needed on the benefits of the keto diet. Having the right ratio of macronutrients — fats, protein and carbohydrates — for keto is key to success, and that can be tricky. When following a keto diet, you need to get about 70 to 80 percent of your calories from fat, 15 to 20 percent from protein and 5 percent from carbs, notes Kristen Mancinelli, MS, RDN, author of The Ketogenic Diet. “It’s not enough to remove sugar and starch from your diet to become ketogenic,” she warns. “You also have to shift your caloric intake to be mainly fat.” It may sound complicated, but with a solid understanding of the basics, you can find success and enjoyment from a keto diet. Here are some expert tips to get you going on the right foot. Keto is not a meat-heavy diet. “The ketogenic diet is a moderate-protein diet, not a high-protein diet at all,” Mancinelli says. “It’s important to not go overboard on the protein if you’re trying to maintain ketosis because it can really prevent you from being in a ketogenic state.” This is because the body can convert excess protein into glucose, and too much glucose in the blood can knock you out of ketosis, Dr. Axe warns. One way to think about it: “My rule of thumb is, you should eat about half the amount of meat or animal protein that you think you should be eating, and add fats and some vegetables on the side,” Mancinelli says. She recommends a modest portion of protein cooked in fat with a side of vegetables covered in a fat-rich sauce, such as one made with tahini, olive oil or butter. Mancinelli also finds that her clients mistake a diet of lean protein and vegetables for keto. “When I look at their food logs, they’ve had an enormous salad with grilled chicken breast, and their fat will be like 30 percent [of the calories], which is not even close to what you need for a ketogenic diet,” she says. If you’re going to have a salad, she recommends adding a fattier type of protein, such as steak or salmon, drizzling with plenty of olive oil or using an oil-rich dressing, adding half of an avocado, and/or sprinkling the top with cheese, nuts or seeds. This Bacon Cheeseburger Bowl will redefine what you think of as a salad. You’ll feel like you’re enjoying an indulgent fast food meal, while actually getting plenty of nutrients and healthy fats. You may not feel great at first. “While on the keto diet, you’ll need to cut out grains, fruits, starchy vegetables, desserts and sugary drinks and snacks from your diet,” Dr. Axe notes. “Because your body is accustomed to using carbs for energy instead of fats, it can be a rocky transition for some people to enter into ketosis. It requires your body to go through some metabolic changes that can cause temporary side effects, such as fatigue, headaches, indigestion, constipation and cravings.” This state, sometimes called the “keto flu,” usually lasts one to two weeks, and once it lifts, you should start to feel better and have more energy. Try this comforting Loaded “Baked Potato” Soup — it’s made with low-carbohydrate cauliflower and radishes (you won’t believe it doesn’t have any potato in it), combines bacon, cheese and olive oil for plenty of fats, and has a moderate amount of protein. It’s important to vary your fats. Bacon and butter are fine some of the time, but a healthy ketogenic diet should also include avocados, nuts and seeds, fatty fish, beef, chicken, cheese, eggs, olive oil and more, so you cover the different types of fats, including saturated, monounsaturated and omega-3, Mancinelli says. “Americans don’t eat enough seafood, that’s something we all could use more of. Most Americans don’t get enough omega-3 fatty acids in their diet, and they get too much omega-6 [largely from vegetable oils]. If you’re looking to shift to a ketogenic diet, you can correct some of these other things, too,” she notes. This Poached Salmon with Green Goddess Sauce combines omega-3-rich salmon with olive oil, sour cream and mayonnaise, so you get the fats you need from a variety of sources. The quality of your food matters. There’s a faction within the keto world that advocates “IIFYM,” or “if it fits your macros,” meaning you can eat any junk food you want, as long as it falls within the fat-protein-carb ratio that makes it technically keto. Since keto is so trendy, plenty of companies are offering snacks, drinks and desserts that are low in carbs and high in fats, and there are scores of Instagram accounts with images of bunless fast-food cheeseburgers. But keto junk food is still junk food, and you won’t get the health benefits you’re after. “The bottom line is, we can shift you to a ketogenic diet, and you can completely destroy your health by continuing to eat junk food that conforms to your ketogenic diet,” Mancinelli says. “If that’s what you’re after, then I recommend that you don’t even bother with the ketogenic part, because you’re wasting the effort.” In order to feel your best while on keto, “Avoid foods with poor quality oils, processed meats, high-sodium foods, fried foods and fast foods,” Dr. Axe says. “While you do still need at least some carbs in your diet, it’s best to select high-fiber, nutrient-rich options to keep carb consumption to a minimum, especially vegetables, which provide important nutrients.” You don’t have to be strictly keto 24/7 for the rest of your life. “Being in ketosis is appropriate for most people for a duration of about two to 12 months — potentially longer if it’s helping to manage a health condition, such as epilepsy or diabetes. This would be decided by a doctor ideally,” Dr. Axe says. “In order to maintain results once the diet is over, you may choose to try approaches like keto-cycling or carb-cycling long-term. These involve eating very low-carb most days of the week, but intentionally increasing carbs on other days to restore glycogen reserves,” which can help some people feel better and make the diet more sustainable. And if keto seems too daunting, that doesn’t mean you can’t incorporate some of its principles and still see benefits. “Many people would benefit from a significantly lower-carbohydrate diet than the average,” Mancinelli says. Reducing your carb intake to around 100 grams per day by avoiding refined products such as breads, crackers and pasta, as well as sugary drinks and desserts, can bring great improvement to your health, she notes. For that 100 grams of carbs, load up on vegetables and enjoy fruit in moderation, so you get plenty of nutrients to boost your health. Try Bell Pepper Keto Nachos as a way to swap a vegetable for a refined carb.

Food,"6 ""Healthy"" Kids Snacks That Aren’t",https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/healthy-tips/2010/09/6-healthy-snacks-to-skip,"Feeding your kids can get confusing. Between pushy food marketing and bewildering labels, it’s no wonder that most folks are misled as to which kids snacks are really healthy. Here's the real deal on what you've been buying. #1: Yogurt Cows don’t make purple, hot pink or even blue-colored yogurt — that’s what I tell my kids every time we hit the dairy aisle. Those neon yogurts are loaded with sugar (including the infamous high fructose corn syrup) and lots of additives and preservatives that don't do any favors to little bodies. Give kids a punch of calcium and protein from healthier dairy products. If your kids are pining for yogurt, here are some healthier options: Stonyfield Yo Baby, Yo Kids and Fat-Free Organic (the French Vanilla is my 5-year-old's fave)Low-Fat Brown Cow YogurtChobani Champions Greek Yogurt  #2: Granola Bars Although a basic granola bar includes a combo of nuts, oats, seeds and sometimes dried fruit (all healthy stuff), many packaged varieties add in pieces of chocolate or candy or loads of sugar and fat. Check out our favorite snack bar brands or make your own granola mix. #3: Meat & Cracker Combos  While they're convenient kid-favorites, most packaged lunch combos come with a side dish of excess salt and fat. With a laundry list of ingredients and preservatives, you're better off packing your own. On your next trip to the market, pick up a package of whole-wheat or rye crackers, Swiss or cheddar cheese and  low-sodium turkey or ham (or leftover turkey or chicken) and pack in compartment-type Tupperware.  You'll save money and control the ingredients. #4: Veggie Chips Once fried and processed, even veggies aren’t that healthy. Heat and various processing techniques destroy many of the vitamins, which are not typically replaced once they’re made into chips. Pack a serving (about 15 chips) for a once-in-a-while snack, but don’t substitute them for actual vegetables. #5: Fruit Snacks Fruit snacks might have the word ""fruit"" in the title, but don’t be fooled. Most of these chewy snacks contain corn syrup and ""natural"" and artificial flavors. If you carefully examine the list of ingredients, you’ll also find vitamin C added back as it’s destroyed during the processing of the snack. Nothing can replace a juicy, fresh fruit, but if you want to serve it up as an occasional treat make sure to brush those little teeth right away. #6: Juice Drinks Lemonade, iced tea and other such juice drinks are loaded with calories, sugar and not much else. Look for 100 percent fruit juice and limit kids to a maximum of 4 fluid ounces per day. Don’t be fooled with the claim that it's excellent source of vitamin C -- you can get just as much (if not more) from good old fresh fruits like kiwi, citrus fruit and strawberries and even a few veggies like bell peppers, tomatoes and potatoes.

Food,Chimichangas,https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/2013/04/chimichangas,"The chimichanga, or chimi as it's affectionately termed in the Southwest, is a deep-fried burrito stuffed with meat, vegetables and spices. Once fried to perfection, chimichangas are often topped with cheese and served with a variety of condiments, such as green onions, diced tomatoes, guacamole, sour cream and black olives. Sounds delicious, right? It is delicious, but  consider that one restaurant-style chimi has around 760 calories, 34 grams of fat and 1,930 mg of sodium. With that much sodium, you're done for the day  -- you'll have reached your daily max in sodium in only one meal. Store-bought frozen chimichangas fare slightly better, with around 300-500 calories, 25 grams of fat and 1,200 mg of sodium per serving. Filling aside, it's the deep-frying that does most of the damage. Regular burritos have about 200-300 calories and 10-20 grams of fat each, but drop them into the deep-fryer and you can add 225 calories and 21 grams of fat to each burrito. Yes, the deep-fried, crunchy exterior is great, but not worth the health consequences, especially when a healthier version is so easy to make. You can stuff flour tortillas with delicious ingredients and then bake the chimichangas in the oven for the same, amazing result. Try this recipe and let me know if you agree. Beef and Cheese Chimichangas     Cooking spray       1 pound extra lean ground beef       1/2 cup chopped white onion       2 cloves garlic, minced       1 teaspoon dried oregano   1 cup picante sauce, regular, medium or hot, plus extra for serving on the side if desired     6 medium flour tortillas (soft taco size)       2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro       Salt and freshly ground black pepper       1/2 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend       1/2 cup chopped green onions       1 beefsteak tomato, chopped       2 tablespoons sliced black olives   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Coat a large skillet with cooking spray and preheat to medium-high. Add the beef to the pan and cook until browned, breaking up the meat as it cooks. Drain away all fat and return the beef to the pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, garlic and oregano and cook for 3 minutes, until the onion is soft and the oregano is fragrant. Add the picante sauce and cook for 1-2 minutes, until the liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat, stir in the cilantro and season to taste with salt and pepper. Arrange the tortillas on a flat surface. Spoon the beef mixture onto the center of each tortilla. Fold over half of the tortilla to cover the filling, tuck in the ends and continue rolling up. Transfer the stuffed tortillas to the prepared baking sheet, seam side down, and spray the surface with cooking spray. Top the tortillas with the cheese. Bake for 15 minutes, until the tortillas are golden brown and the cheese melts. Serve the chimichangas with the green onions, tomato and black olives.

Food,"Katie's Healthy Bites: Exotic Rices, Explained",https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/2010/05/katies-healthy-bites-exotic-rices-explained,"Rice is a dietary staple in cultures all around the world, and with over 40,000 different varieties, it can be difficult to decide which rice is right for you. I used to steer clear of the rice aisle because I always felt it was time consuming and difficult to cook. Now it is a staple in my diet. I figured if I shared a few facts and tips rice could become a staple in your diet too. Size Matters! There is a difference between long grain and short/medium grain rice and one is in the way it cooks. Short and medium grain rice tends to produce a stickier final product where long grain rice is fluffy and light when cooked. So many choices! If you are like me, you have stood in the rice aisle and stared at the many varieties with no idea which you should choose. Hopefully these brief descriptions can help you out. Arborio Rice: Primarily used in risottos, this medium-grain, round rice is named after the town in Italy where it is grown. Arborio rice has a creamy, slightly chewy texture when cooked. Basmati Rice: A long-grain, aromatic rice from India and Pakistan. It has a nutty flavor and light, fluffy texture when cooked. Bhutanese Red Rice: Grown at 8000 feet in the town of Bhutan this short-grained red rice is irrigated by a glacier rich in minerals. It has a nutty, earthy flavor and soft texture when cooked. Black Rice: Also known as forbidden rice, this short-grain rice that originated in Asia is black when raw and deep purple when cooked. It is rich in fiber, minerals and amino acids and has a nutty flavor. Brown Rice: Short, medium and long grained rice that is milled to remove the hull but keep the bran in tact. It is more nutritious then white rice because the bran contains an abundance of vitamins, minerals and fiber. Jasmine Rice: Aromatic, long-grain rice grown in Thailand that cooks up soft and slightly sticky. Jasmine rice is a good source of complex carbohydrates. Cooking Rice: Here is where it can get tricky. Rice cooks a bit differently depending on the type so here are a few basic steps to get a perfect final product. Rinse and drain your rice. It helps to remove sediment, excess starch and makes the grains less brittle.Use 1 1/2-1 3/4 cups water to one cup white rice and about 2 cups water to 1 cup brown rice. You can experiment with how much water you like. The more water the softer or stickier the rice will be.Use a heavy based pot to prevent burning and a tight fitting lid to allow steam to form.Let the rice sit for 5-10 minutes once cooking completes. A few more tidbits: Still not comfortable? A rice cooker is the answer for perfectly cooked rice every time!Love the boxed rice mixes but hate all the sodium…just omit or use half of the seasoning packet to significantly cut back on the salt.Want rice in a pinch? Pre-cooked, frozen white and brown rice is available at the grocery store (Whole Foods and Trader Joes have it for sure).Rice is not just a side on your dinner plate…it's also used in other preparations such as desserts and salads. Try this quick and simple orange pistachio rice salad recipe for a flavorful side. Katie Cavuto Boyle, MS, RD, is a registered dietitian, personal chef and owner of HealthyBites, LLC.
