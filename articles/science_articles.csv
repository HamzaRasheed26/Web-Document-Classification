Science/Education,The Largest Bird On Earth Also Has The Largest Eyes Of Any Land Animal,https://www.iflscience.com/the-largest-bird-on-earth-also-has-the-largest-eyes-of-any-land-animal-73982,"We're going to put it out there: ostriches are weird, but they are also very cool. Not only are they the largest bird on the planet, growing up to 2.8 meters (9.2 feet) tall but they are also the fastest flightless birds out there. But did you also know that they also have the largest eyes of any land animal? In fact, their eyes are so large that they dwarf their own brains by comparison. Ostrich eyes are really big. They are about 2 inches (5 cm) across, which makes them about five times larger than a human eye. The optical design of their eyes is set up in a way that the lens and cornea contribute equally to the total optical power. Interestingly, analysis of ostrich eyes hasrevealedthem to effectively be scaled-up versions of the eyes of other birds, like the common starling and even the tawny owl. This similarity may be quite striking at first, considering that the eyes of these two bird species appear to have different shapes. This, it has been hypothesized, may be a result of the birds' differing weights. For instance, the overall shape of anowl eyemay result from the evolution of a large eye – both in terms of its aperture and axial length (the measure from the front to the back) – which needs to fit into a small skull and still be light enough for powerful flight. However, because they are flightless birds, ostriches are not constrained by the same weight issues, so they have developed the characteristic global shape to their massive peepers. This may offer a range of advantages, especially in relation to the size of the visual field it would offer the bird. Ostriches have amonocular field– the vision in each eye individually – that extends to about 155°, which helps them scan the horizon for potential dangers. However, ostriches have a substantial blind spot above and behind their heads which is caused by the way their eyes sit in their skulls to protect them from the tropic sun. This type of natural shielding may be needed to prevent retinal damage, but it does make them look like angry sock puppets. Ostriches also havebinocularvision in front of their bills which is invaluable for searching for food. This visual field extends vertically through 80° and up to a width of around 20°. It’s quite a small range, but it helps them to forage for food on the ground. As they are principally herbivores, this means ostriches need to be able to focus on small objects like leaves, seeds, and flowers. They also sometimes eat small insects and vertebrates when the feeling takes them (we’ve all been there) so this visual field also helps them target potentially moving prey. Yet while their eyes are colossal and bulging, they are ridiculous compared to the bird’s modestly sized brain. Ostriches have brains that areabout59.26 mm (2.3 inches) long and about 42.30 mm (1.6 inches) wide. Visually, this would look like a golf ball wired up to two billiard balls. Still, the birds have clearlyevolvedin a way that does not need them to have a large brain. If hiding doesn’t work, the bird can usually just outrun any problems that come its way.",540
Science/Education,"At Long Last, We Know Some Of The Math Behind Flocking Birds",https://www.iflscience.com/at-long-last-we-know-some-of-the-math-behind-flocking-birds-73978,"There’s something about the immense beauty and mystery of nature that just can’t help but make you think:math. Take, for example, a new study in which an international team of researchers have figured out the previously unknown formulas behindflocking– or at least, some small part of the phenomenon – allowing us to at long last harness the ingenuity of nature for our own mechanical purposes. “This area of research is important since animals are known to take advantage of the flows, such as of air or water, left by other members of a group to save on the energy needed to move or to reduce drag or resistance,” explained Leif Ristroph, an associate professor at New York University’s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and the senior author of the paper, in astatement. The team restricted their study to birds moving in a column – those formations in which groups of flyers will line up directly behind each other – rather than attempting some of themore adventurousmurmurations achieved by some species of bird. That shouldn’t be seen as a shortcoming, by the way – those movements can be so complex as toresemble the quantum dynamics of superfluid helium, and even collecting sufficient data to model equations from can beprohibitively difficult. In fact, previous work on the math behind flocking has considered even fewer birds: only two, ina paper from the same teamsome five years ago. But the new paper has shown just how important expanding the study was to understanding the movements of these groups of animals – because as it turns out, the effects of the dynamics involved actually depend on the size of the group. “The aerodynamic interactions in small bird flocks help each member to hold a certain special position relative to their leading neighbor,” explained Sophie Ramananarivo, an assistant professor at École Polytechnique Paris and one of the paper’s authors. “But larger groups are disrupted by an effect that dislodges members from these positions and may cause collisions.” This observation was confirmed with a “mock flock” – mechanical replica wings, created by the team and driven through water to model the air flow around real birds inflight.  The cut-off point, they discovered, was about four: fewer flyers than that, and the aerodynamic interactions are a help to each individual relative to the others, Ristroph explained. “If a flyer is displaced from its position, the vortices or swirls of flow left by the leading neighbor help to push the follower back into place and hold it there,” he said. “This means the flyers can assemble into an orderly queue of regular spacing automatically and with no extra effort, since the physics does all the work.” More than that, however, and staying in formation gets difficult. “[The] flow interactions cause later members to be jostled around and thrown out of position, typically causing a breakdown of the flock due to collisions among members,” Ristroph said. “This means that the very long groups seen in some types of birds are not at all easy to form.” Essentially, the team discovered, eachbirdis affected by the bird in front – but is unable to exert any reciprocal effect back to its predecessor. These waves, dubbed “flonons” by the researchers, add up through the column, so by the time we get to the back of the queue, birds can be oscillating wildly: they “likely have to constantly work to hold their positions and avoid crashing into their neighbors,” Ristroph explained.  But while that’s all very interesting, is it particularly helpful for those of us without feathers? Well, in fact, yes. “Our findings […] raise some interesting connections to material physics,” pointed out Joel Newbolt, an NYU graduate student in physics at the time of research. “[The] birds in an orderly flock are analogous to atoms in a regularcrystal.” And the study might have some more immediate real-world implications, too, Ristroph added. “Our work may also have applications in transportation – like efficient propulsion through air or water,” he suggested, “and energy, such as more effectively harvesting power from wind, water currents, or waves.” The study is published in the journalNature Communications.",688
Science/Education,Giant 2.7-Meter-Long Prehistoric Salmon Had Tusk-Like Teeth Rather Than Massive Fangs,https://www.iflscience.com/giant-27-meter-long-prehistoric-salmon-had-tusk-like-teeth-rather-than-massive-fangs-73969,"Around five million years ago, the rivers of North America were home to an enormous salmon that would make today’s largest specimens look like minnows. It may have grown up to 8.9 feet (2.7 meters) long and was thought to have incredibly long fangs like a saber-toothed tiger. However, new research has found that this was not the case. Rather than a saber-toothed salmon, the fish actually had spike-like tusks similar to warthogs today. The monster salmon,Oncorhynchus rastrosus, was first described in the 1970s and is thought to be the largest member of the Salmonidae family to have ever lived. At the time of its discovery, researchers assumed that it had two oversized front teeth that pointed backward into its mouth like fangs. This was mostly because the fossil fragments they were working with were damaged – the teeth were found separate from the skulls. They therefore based their thinking on currentsalmonanatomy and other animals of that era. As such,O. rastrosushas traditionally been known as the “saber-toothed salmon”, but this was a red herring. Having examined fossils recovered in 2014, researchers have now determined thatO. rastrosustoothy protrusions actually faced outwards, like tusks. So the saber-toothed salmon is no more. All hail the “spike-toothed salmon.” “I’m delighted that we have been able to put a new face on the giant spike-tooth salmon, bringing knowledge from the field in Oregon to the world,” Edward Davis, associate professor of earth sciences at the University of Oregon and director of Condon Collection at the UO’s Museum of Natural and Cultural History explained in astatement. Despite this revelation intoothorientation, it is still unclear what these tusks were actually used for. The researchers believe they were most likely used for fighting, either to duel other spike-toothed salmon or to defend against predators. This would have been particularly useful for the fish as they swam upstream to spawn – then as now, this journey would have been perilous for many. It is also possible that the tusks had multiple purposes, they may have also been used to dig nests and to defend them from other salmon looking to sneak in themselves. However, the team doubts the teeth were used for hunting prey. This is becauseO. rastrosusis thought to have been a filter feeder that fed on plankton. So a giant fish using tusks to eat tiny organisms drifting in water would be like use using a wrecking ball to make a salad. “We have known for decades that these extinct salmon from Central Oregon were the largest to ever live,” Kerin Claeson, professor of anatomy at Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine added. “Discoveries like ours show they probably weren't gentle giants. These massive spikes at the tip of their snouts would have been useful to defend against predators, compete against other salmon, and ultimately build the nests where they would incubate their eggs."" Interestingly, it seems these tusk-teeth were present on both male and female salmon, which means, as Brian Sidlauskas, professor and curator of fishes at Oregon State University, notes “the sexes were equally fearsome.” O. rastrosuswent extinct over five million years ago when the oceans cooled, but their biology tells us a great deal about habits that may appear in the next hundred years as climate change continues. If things continue as they are, it is possible we will see warm oceans similar to those that were home to the spike-toothed salmon. The paper is published in the journalPLOS ONE.",575
Science/Education,What Is The Highest A Bird Can Fly?,https://www.iflscience.com/what-is-the-highest-a-bird-can-fly-73971,"There are many impressive things about birds. Some soar for mileswithout ever flapping their wings; some live forover half a century; and some areliteral rainbows. But when you look at a bird gliding high up in the distance, have you ever wondered just how high they can go? The species that holds the record for the highest flight of any bird is the Rüppell's vulture (Gyps rueppellii). In 1973, one Rüppell's vulture struck a commercial aircraft 11,300 meters (37,000 feet) above Côte d'Ivoire in West Africa. While one of its engines was damaged, the plane managed a successful landing. The bird was unfortunately not so lucky. All that remained of it werefive complete and 15 partial feathers– enough for a positive ID of the species, and for this incredible feat to be confirmed, but probably scant comfort to any friends of the deceased. We jest, but sadly this bird probably did have friends, and maybe even a significant other. They’re very social and are thought to formmonogamouspair bonds, with both parents helping to take care of any chicks for the first 150 days of their lives. Native to a region of Africa called the Sahel, which spans a swathe of land between the Sahara and the Sudanian savanna, the vulture’s home range covers multiple countries including Zimbabwe, Senegal, and Ethiopia. From time to time, they’ve also popped up across the Mediterranean inSpain. Unfortunately, though, these kinds of visits might become more of a rarity in the future, as the Rüppell's vulture has been classified by theIUCN Red Listas Critically Endangered. Like many similar African birds, they’re threatened by habitat loss,hunting, and decreased availability of their sole food source, carrion. There’s also a big problem with poisoning, especially in East Africa. This has largely been from a pesticide called carbofuran, but the charityBirdLife Internationalalso highlights the role of the drug diclofenac. Thisanti-inflammatorycan be used in veterinary treatment but isfatalto Rüppell's vultures if they ingest the carcasses of animals that have been dosed with it. Surprising, when you consider that they canhappily chow downon meat that’s infested with anthrax and botulism. If you ever are lucky enough to spot a Rüppell's vulture in the flesh, it’s a sight you won’t forget in a hurry. These majestic birds reach heights of almost a meter (33-38 inches) and have a distinctive feather-free head –Animaliawrites that this adaptation stems from their tendency to stick their whole heads inside their prey while they feast upon it. Their powerful wings span over 2 meters (7-8 feet), but they use them sparingly inflight. Even when they’re not causing a headache for commercial pilots, Rüppell's vultures regularly reach impressive altitudes, taking advantage of strong thermals as they soar over the ground and scan for their prey. It’s quite possible, even likely, that the 1973 event was ananomaly. There are reasons why you don’t generally see birds flying alongside passenger planes at cruising altitude, most of them having to do with oxygen. Othercontendersin the altitude stakes include the common crane (Grus grus), which has been recorded at 10,000 meters (32,800 feet) as it evades eagles in the Himalayas, and the bar-headed goose (Anser indicus), which has been spotted at a maximum height of 7,300 meters (24,000 feet) and hassupersized lungsto cope with the lack of oxygen. Still,BBC Wildlifereports that even with moderntrackingtechnology, we’ve no record of another bird coming close to the Rüppell's vulture’s record, so its crown looks safe for now.",572
Science/Education,Hidden Bacteria âBiosphereâ Found Lurking 4 Meters Beneath Earthâs Driest Hot Desert,https://www.iflscience.com/hidden-bacteria-biosphere-found-lurking-4-meters-beneath-earths-driest-hot-desert-73967,"An abundance of microbial life has been found in Chile’sAtacama Desert, lurking up to 4 meters (13 feet) below the surface of one of the most arid and inhospitable places on the planet. The Atacama is the driest nonpolar desert – but not thedriest place on Earth, that title belongs to somewhere you might not expect – receiving just1 to 3 millimeters(0.04 to 0.1 inches) of precipitation per year in some places. But that hasn’t stopped life from thriving there. While higher life forms are almost entirely absent, bacteria are known to inhabit the bone-dry, salty, and sulfate-rich soil – even at great depths. In a previously unexplored underground habitat in the Yungay region of the desert, researchers have found a surprisingly diverse community of microbes likely completely isolated from life at the surface. Previous research has focused mostly on soil at the surface, meaning that, until now, what lies deep underground has been a bit of a mystery. “To our knowledge, this represents the deepest microbial survey and discovery of microbial life in Atacama soils to this day,” the team write in a new study describing their findings. Digging down into the hyper-arid soil to a depth of 4.2 meters (13.8 feet), the researchers took regular soil samples before using a new method of molecular DNA analysis to isolate onlyDNAthat originates from living organisms. Doing so has enabled them to uncover a hidden biosphere that is helping to expand our understanding of biodiversity in the Atacama Desert and beyond. In the upper 80 centimeters (31.5 inches) of soil, the team found that communities were dominated by Firmicutes (or Bacillota) – a phylum of bacteria that includesLactobacillusandEnterococcus. However, their numbers decreased as the depth and also salinity of the soil increased, resulting in a cessation of microbial life in the deepest samples between 80 and 200 centimeters (78.7 inches). But below 200 centimeters, microbes reemerge. Here, a different microbial population was observed, dominated by Actinobacteria. The authors suggest that this community might have colonized the soil 19,000 years ago, before being buried by further soil deposits. They could, the team hypothesize, extend much deeper than 4.2 meters and may “represent the upper extent of a deep biosphere underneath hyperarid desert soils”. To survive at such depths, the bacteria may rely on the mineralgypsumas a water source, which could have important implications for – believe it or not – the search for extraterrestrial life. “The exploration of gypsum-associated subsurface environments in the Atacama Desert has direct relevance to astrobiology, since gypsum deposits onMarsare [...] not only evidence of past liquid water but could also possibly serve as a source of water for present microbial life,” the team write in their conclusion. “Thus, the data from this study is helping us to understand if and how life may exist in similar environments on other planets or moons across our Solar System.” The study is published in the journalPNAS Nexus.",487
Science/Education,What Was The Largest Animal To Ever Walk The Earth?,https://www.iflscience.com/what-was-the-largest-animal-to-ever-walk-the-earth-73961,"We currently live on Earth alongside the most massive animal that’s ever lived: theblue whale, a colossal marine mammal that can measure up to 33.5 meters (110 feet) and weigh more than 150,000 kilograms (330,000 pounds). However, when it comes to land-dwelling animals, much larger beasts have roamed compared to today’s giants. The largest terrestrial animal to have ever walked the planet is a record currently held byPatagotitan mayorum, which stretched 37 meters (121 feet) in length. They weighed an estimated 70 tons, or 70,000 kilograms (154,323 pounds) — the equivalent of 10 African elephants, the largest terrestrial species alive today. Although longer than a blue whale, the plodding dinosaur is considerably lighter and nowhere near as massive. This prehistoric heavyweight was asauropod, a subgroup of dinosaurs known for their tremendously long necks and equally lengthy tails, as well as their four trunk-like legs that stationed them on the ground like pillars. Other well-known members of this gangly gang includeDiplodocus,Brontosaurus, andPatosaurus. As the name suggests,Patagotitan mayorumlived in the Patagonia region of modern-day southern Argentina. By no coincidence, this land was also the home ofArgentinosaurus, which was previously thought to be the largest dinosaur beforePatagotitan mayorumwas found. Some contendthatArgentinosaurusis larger thanPatagotitanand, therefore, should keep its crown as the largest ever terrestrial animal. Truth be told, size estimates are, by their very nature, estimates. Complete specimens have never been discovered and their size is based on incomplete remains, leaving some margin of error.  Six fossils of the humungous species were unearthed in Patagonia and used tofirst describe the species in 2017, much to the amazement of scientists and the public alike. The sediment around the remains suggests they lived around 100 million years ago in the Cretaceous period. Based on their shape and stature, it’s reasonable to assumePatagotitan mayorumwas a herbivore that used its lanky neck to munch tall trees. Its lumbering weight also suggests the dinosaur was not a ferocious monster, but a gentle giant. ""I don't think they were scary at all. They were probably massive big slow-moving animals,” Diego Pol, a palaeontologist from the Egidio Feruglio Paleontology Museum in Argentina who described the species,said in 2017upon its discovery. “Getting up. Walking around. Trying to run. It's really challenging for large animals,"" he added. Being this size does have its benefits, though. It’s hard to imagine any predator would be able to take on a fully-grown sauropod. In fact, protection from predators is likely to beone of the main selective pressuresthat allowedPatagotitan mayorumto reach this size. Patagotitan mayorumis not the uncontested champion, and there is always the chance alarger species could be unearthed. Excavations of South America are still in their infancy compared to the Northern Hemisphere where dinosaurs have been extensively studiedsince the 19th century. Considering the number of titanosaurs that have been recovered from rocky Patagonia, it’s a possibility that a larger species might someday be found.",479
Science/Education,"NOAA Is Offering $20,000 For Info On Who Shot This Dolphin",https://www.iflscience.com/noaa-is-offering-20000-for-info-on-who-shot-this-dolphin-73958,"For reasons that are unclear, a dolphin has been shot dead at a beach in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Office of Law Enforcement is now on the hunt for the perpetrator and is offering a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to a criminal conviction. The juvenile bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) was found dead on March 13 along the shores of West Mae’s Beach a few miles from the Sabine Pass Lighthouse, according to an NOAAstatement. Scientists carried out a necropsy of the animal, revealing several bullets lodged in its brain, spinal cord, and heart. By no surprise, it appears the dolphin died as a result of this trauma. Harassing, harming, killing, or even feeding wild dolphins is prohibited under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. Breaking this law can land people with up to $100,000 in fines and up to one year in jail per violation. Anyone with information about the incident on West Mae’s Beach is urged to call the NOAA Enforcement Hotline at (800) 853-1964. If the information leads to a criminal conviction or the assessment of a civil penalty, members of the public could receive a reward of up to $20,000. Tips can be left anonymously, although you’ll need to provide your identity if you wish to claim the reward. Sadly, this isn’t the first time such an incident has occurred in the US. In 2020, two dolphinswashed up in Floridawith gruesome injuries caused by a gun or a sharp weapon. The NOAA said at the time that at least 29 other dolphins had washed up in the Southeast US since 2002, often with unusual injuries that appear to be inflicted with a weapon. The reason for the attacks was unclear. However, some speculated the rising number of malicious attacks was linked to people attempting to feed the dolphins. This leads to dolphins associating people or boats with a meal, raising the chances of an unfortunate run-in with humans, whether that’s a boat collision or an act of violence.Dolphinsare also known to steal bycatch, leading to tensions with fishermen that can erupt into violence. Globally, common bottlenose dolphins are designated as “Least Concern” on theIUCN Red List, meaning there is currently little risk they will fall into extinction. However, they do face a myriad of threats, including entanglement in fishing nets, ocean pollution, habitat loss, andclimate change.",400
Science/Education,Horoscopes For Squid? Their Dates Of Birth Determine How They Will Mate,https://www.iflscience.com/horoscopes-for-squid-their-dates-of-birth-determine-how-they-will-mate-73957,"As we all know,astrology is not a real science. However, when you’re asquidthe day you hatch is perhaps more important than you might think. New research has revealed that the day a male squid hatches is linked to which mating tactic he will use for the rest of his life. Spear squid (Heterololigo bleekeri) can either be “sneakers” or “consorts”, write the authors of a new study. The consorts are more likely to fight for mating opportunities while the sneakers – as the name suggests – use less overt tactics to win over a female. The team found that the traditional consorts hatched earlier in the season than the sneakers. “Our results showed that the hatching date determines the whole life trajectory in this species,” said Associate Professor Yoko Iwata from the Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute at the University of Tokyo, in astatement. The consorts fight for opportunities and then placetheir spermdirectly inside the female; they will even guard their female while she lays her eggs. The sneakers, by contrast, sneak up to a female and place their sperm on her outsides, in the hopes of fertilizing her nearby eggs. Between early April and mid-July, the male squids that hatched were able to become larger and develop into consorts. The sneaker squids were hatched in early June through to mid-August and did not become as large. During the overlap in the month of July, thesquidshad an equal chance of becoming either of the two mating types. What is extra interesting is even if a squid that was born earlier managed to grow to the size of a sneaker by the early breeding season, it would not breed and would instead concentrate on becoming large enough to become a consort. “The difference in hatch date means that the squid experience different environmental conditions in early life, which may influence the growth trajectory. If an extreme environmental event, such as an oceanheat wave, happens during the hatching season, it could affect the squid’s mature body size and subsequent mating tactic. This would also impact the amount that could be commercially caught enormously,” continued Iwata. Until now this idea, which is called the “birth date hypothesis”, has only been seen in fish; this discovery suggests that this could be present in a lot more species than previously thought. The researchers were expecting to find a big difference in growth rate between the sneakers and the consorts as they grow in different seasons. However, the results showed that there was not a big difference, which is extra surprising because of how sensitive squid are to environmental conditions. To age a squid, the team uses a structure called a statolith, which grow every day in layers and are similar totree ringsin the way they can be used to measure age. The layers also contain microelements that can help explain environmental conditions in the water when the layer was formed. The team now plan to look at the environmental conditions present in a squid's earlier life and see if this plays a part in which mating tactic they eventually use. The study is published inProceedings Of The Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.",527
Science/Education,Meet A Megaraptor: New Dinosaur Footprints Reveal Raptors Grew Scarily Big,https://www.iflscience.com/meet-a-megaraptor-new-dinosaur-footprints-reveal-raptors-grew-scarily-big-73951,"A remarkable coincidence has seen a late Cretaceous mudflat preserve the footprints of two different types of raptors. More astonishingly still, one of these prints comes from a previously unknown species larger than any raptor we have previously found. Until we find the bones, there is a lot we can’t know about the creatures namedFujianipus yingliangibut they’re estimated to have been 1.8 meters (5 foot 11 inches) high at the hip, and a terrifying 5 meters (16 feet) long, much larger thanJurassic Park'salready supersized velociraptors. Stand by for future big-screen appearances. Raptor footprints are distinctive because they only had two load-bearing claws. One of their four claws on each foot was small. The second claw was larger and its role is debated, having originally been proposed for slashing rivals and threats. However,Dr Anthony Romilioof the University of Queensland told IFLScience the current favored theory is it was used to hold down prey while the mouth ripped into them.  Whatever its purpose, this claw became so specialized it wasn’t used for walking, making raptor prints easily distinguishable from those of all other dinosaur families. Ancient mud in Longyan prefecture, Fujian, China, preserves a remarkable variety of dinosaur prints, but one horizon is particularly remarkable, hosting two sets of raptor prints. One set is small and is thought to come from a 1-meterVelociraptor, which was substantially more diminutive than movies make them out to be. The other prints, however, are around 36 centimeters (15 inches) long. There’s a rule of thumb that you multiply the length of the footprint by four to get the height of a dinosaur at the hip. However, we found a ratio more like 5.5 times. “There’s a rule of thumb that you multiply the length of the footprint by four to get the height of a dinosaur at the hip,” Romilio told IFLScience. Even this would indicate a creature considerably larger than a human. However, Romilio added that where we have been able to match raptor bones to prints we have found a ratio “more like 5.5 times”. This could indicate a creature whose hips would tower over most humans, even without worrying about the rest of them. Romilio and co-authors have gone for an estimate somewhere in the middle. “When people think of raptor dinosaurs, they most likely think of those in theJurassic Parkmovies – human-sized, muscly, aggressive hunters,” Romilio said in an emailed statement. “But these tracks were left by a much slimmer and brainier group in theVelociraptorfamily known asTroodontids, which emerged in the late Jurassic period around 95 million years ago."" “Interestingly, some of our research team has also worked on theworld’s tiniest dinosaur footprints– raptor tracks in South Korea that are just one centimetre long,” Romilio added. “It just goes to show the incredible size range among raptor dinosaurs, highlighting their adaptability and ecological diversity.” Although there is evidence the raptor family grew to considerable size in Arctic regions, these prints suggest something larger than we have seen before, and a lot further south than anything close. The nameFujianipus yingliangireflects the tracks' location.  Romilio calls the coincidence of these two species, both of which must have been rarer than the herbivores they preyed on, making tracks together “amazing”. However, it does seem to be a coincidence. Both were walking relatively slowly and not in the same direction, so it doesn’t seem like theFujianipuswas seeking to add some smaller raptor to its diet. That coincidence did increase the authors’ confidence the larger tracks are from a raptor, rather than some oddity of the location disguising the third claw of a different theropod family. The age of the horizon has not been dated precisely, but falls into the 80-105 million years ago range. Disturbingly, Romilio and co-authors write that raptors appear to have been getting larger as the Cretaceous wore on. That asteroid/comet really may have done the planet a favor. The findings are open access iniScience-Cell Press.",653
Science/Education,Scientists Just Discovered The First-Ever Fractal Molecule In Nature,https://www.iflscience.com/scientists-just-discovered-the-first-ever-fractal-molecule-in-nature-73949,"Fractals – those self-similar shapes which can be endlessly zoomed in on without losing detail – are weirdly ubiquitous in nature. You’ve gotsnowflakes, famously;cauliflowersandcoastlines; evenrabbits, with a bit of work, can be shown to conform to fractal patterns. Of course, none of these examples cantrulybe said to be fractal outside of the math classroom – the real world simply doesn’t work that way. Whilst for mathematicians, zooming into infinity and its reciprocal just requires taking a couple of limits, the rest of us will eventually have to deal with things like “atoms” – and theconsequences of trying to go smaller than that. Which raises a question: how small can we actually go? And according to a recent discovery led by researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Marburg, Germany, the answer is… almost all the way. “All known regular fractals in nature are made by living organisms and exist at the macroscopic scale. However, none have yet been discovered in nature at the molecular scale,” explains the team in a new paper describing the find. But that’s all changed now: “We report the discovery of a natural metabolic enzyme capable of formingSierpiński trianglesin dilute aqueous solution at room temperature,” the paper reports. In other words, they’ve discovered the first-ever naturally occurring fractal molecule. “We stumbled on this structure completely by accident,” first author Franziska Sendker said in astatementon the find. “[We] almost couldn’t believe what we saw when we first took images of it using an electron microscope.” “The protein makes these beautiful triangles,” she explained, “and as the fractal grows, we see these larger and larger triangular voids in the middle of them, which is totally unlike any protein assembly we’ve ever seen before.” So what makes this molecule so different from all the others? With the help of electron microscopy, the team was eventually able to decipher its structure – and what they found defied expectations for how proteins can assemble. To put it simply, this particular molecule – a citrate synthase from the cyanobacteriumSynechococcus elongatus– just isn’t as particular as normal proteins. Instead of building itself up symmetrically, with each individual protein chain being identical in arrangement to its neighbors,S. elongatusassembled itself slightly wonkily. The result? A Sierpiński triangle structure, holding up even as the proteins grow larger. “This was one of the harder, but also more fascinating structures I have solved in my career,” said Jan Schuller, a researcher at Philipps University Marburg, whose group helped determine the structure. “The problem with determining the structure of a fractal is that our image averaging techniques kept getting confused by the fact that the smaller triangles can be substructures of larger triangles,” he explained. “The algorithm kept homing in on these smaller triangles instead of seeing the larger structures they were part of.” And the best part? It seems like this so-far unique molecular structure might have arisen completely by accident. “[W]e can never be totally sure of the reasons why things happened in the past,” said Georg Hochberg, an evolutionary biologist and senior author of the study. But, he explained, “this particular case does have all the trappings of a seemingly complex biological structure that just popped into existence for no good reason at all because it was simply very easy to evolve.” Which is exciting, to say the least. Because let’s face it: if molecular-scale Sierpiński triangles have been around us all along, popping up basically randomly just because they could – then what else might be out there, just waiting to be discovered next?

Science/Education,Bioluminescent Animals Have Been Glowing For At Least 540 Million Years,https://www.iflscience.com/bioluminescent-animals-have-been-glowing-for-at-least-540-million-years-73948,"Evidence has been found for bioluminescence having existed among animals 540 million years ago, more than doubling the previous record. Besides altering how we picture the oceans of the world in the Ediacaran era and thereafter, the finding could shed light (sorry) on the reasons bioluminescence evolved and is so widely used today. The capacity to produce light is widely used across many species of animals, fungi, and single-celled organisms. Remarkablymore than 100examples of the capacity evolving independently, rather than being inherited from a common ancestral species, have been identified. Some organisms that can’t do it themselves have recruited others into symbiotic relationships. The benefits are sometimes obvious, such as attracting mates or luring prey. However, it takes a lot of energy to make light, and biologists often wonder how the reward justifies that expenditure. The discovery of its deep roots among Anthozoa could change that. “Nobody quite knows why [bioluminescence] first evolved in animals,” said Dr Andrea Quattrini of the Smithsonian Museum in astatement. Quattrini is the museum’s curator of corals and investigated why soft corals sometimes glow when disturbed, puzzling behavior for creatures whose vulnerability makes drawing attention to themselves hazardous. With colleagues, Quattrini found bioluminescence predates the soft corals themselves and can be traced to before the branching off ofgorgonianslike sea fans and sea pens, fellow members of the octocoral class. ""We wanted to figure out the timing of the origin of bioluminescence, and octocorals are one of the oldest groups of animals on the planet known to bioluminesce,"" said Dr Danielle DeLeo. ""So, the question was when did they develop this ability?"" Not all octocorals are bioluminescent, but a great many are, particularly those that inhabit deeper waters. Using a family tree that reveals 185 octocorals’ relationships to each other, DeLeo, Quattrini, and co-authors looked for species that use bioluminescence today to investigate the chance their ancestors did too. “If we know these species of octocorals living today are bioluminescent, we can use statistics to infer whether their ancestors were highly probable to be bioluminescent or not,"" Quattrini said. ""The more living species with the shared trait, the higher the probability that as you move back in time that those ancestors likely had that trait as well."" The results were verified using several statistical approaches, all of which produced the same result – the ancestral octocoral, from which the entire class comes, was probably bioluminescent. The fact all octocorals use the same chemicals to make light indicates modern light-makers inherited their talent from this one event. Genetic and fossil evidence places this at around 540 million years ago, 273 million years before ostracod crustaceans, previously thought to be the oldest example of bioluminescence in the animal kingdom. Presumably, the trait carried some evolutionary benefit, and continues to do so today, although whether the advantages are the same in the very different modern world is unknown. An intriguing hypothesis proposes that bioluminescence originally appeared as a way of disposing of excessive oxygen, with the light a side-effect that subsequently turned out to be useful. Although unproven, the authors consider this idea compatible with what they have learned and think bioluminescence may have evolved in a relatively shallow-water species and allowed diversification into the depths.  There are some 3,500 known octocoral species – and almost certainly many more undiscovered – so the sample of 185 used for this study is small. You’d have to do a lot of coral bumping to test all of them for luminescence, and might miss the light if it’s faint, but the team are working on a genetic test that could solve the question in the lab. As inhabitants of coral reefs, shallow water soft corals, and most gorgonians, are among the more vulnerable species to climate change, and many face more local threats like pollution and overfishing. Deeper waters are probably safer, but threatened by bottom-trawling. The authors hope what they have learned will in some way contribute to their survival, or perhaps just make people more keen to save these sources of beauty.

Science/Education,New Species Of Extinct Kangaroo Was Twice The Weight Of Today's Big Boys,https://www.iflscience.com/new-species-of-extinct-kangaroo-was-twice-the-weight-of-todays-big-boys-73946,"Aussie scientists have uncovered three new species of giant extinct kangaroo that once skipped around the outback of Australia as well as the forested mountains of Tasmania and New Guinea. The three new species are members of the extinct genusProtemnodon, which lived from around 5 million to 40,000 years ago. The biggest of the bunch –Protemnodon viator— weighed up to 170 kilograms (374 pounds), twice as much as the largest male red kangaroos of today. The prehistoric giant also lived in similar habitats to the modern species. Its species name “viator” is Latin for “traveler,” owing to the species' long limbs that allowed it to hop efficiently across vast distances. The researchers also describedProtemnodon mamkurra, a thick-bonedkangaroothat was so hefty it was bound to four legs most of the time and only briefly hopped like a quokka. “A large but thick-boned and robust kangaroo, it was probably fairly slow-moving and inefficient. It may have hopped only rarely, perhaps just when startled,"" Dr Isaac Kerr, study author and kangaroo palaeontologist at Flinders University, said in astatement. Last but not least, there wasProtemnodon dawsonae,another species that the researchers imagine to be a medium-paced dweller of eastern Australia’s forests and woodlands. They might look like upright deer or overgrown rodents, but kangaroos are part of a separate branch of pouch-bearing mammals known as marsupials, meaning they are more closely related to koalas, opossums,Tasmanian devils, and wombats. More specifically, kangaroos are part of a family of marsupials called Macropodidae, which includes the extinct branchProtemnodon. Protemnodonwas described in 1874 by Sir Richard Owen, a British palaeontologist who’s most famous forcoining the word “dinosaur”. Basing his conclusions on fossilized teeth, Owen split the genus down into six species. Over the past 150 years, his work has been reworked and built upon. For instance, it’s become evident that some of the animals he thought were distinct were actually the same species. Likewise, there were a handful of species that he failed to recognize. The latest research reviewed the wholeProtemnodongenus using extensive fossil evidence and concluded there are seven known species, each of which was adapted to live in differing environments of prehistoricAustraliaand New Guinea. “It’s great to have some clarity on the identities of the species ofProtemnodon,” explained Professor Gavin Prideaux, a co-author of the study and professor at Flinders University. “The fossils of this genus are widespread and they’re found regularly, but more often than not you have no way of being certain which species you’re looking at. This study may help researchers feel more confident when working withProtemnodon.” The new study is published in the journalMegataxa.",431
Science/Education,Tiger Kills Crocodile And Is Filmed Feasting On It With Her Cubs,https://www.iflscience.com/tiger-kills-crocodile-and-is-filmed-feasting-on-it-with-her-cubs-73908,"A Bengal tiger and her cubs were spotted by tourists as they feasted on acrocodilein Ranthambore National Park in Rajasthan, India. The 6-year-old tiger T-124, aka Riddhi, had been spotted pursuing these scaly targets previously. A videosharedin February shows her approaching a crocodile from the water’s edge – although that particular crocodile managed to escape into the water. The same can’t be said for a more recent catch of Riddhi’s though, with images and videos showing thetigerand her three cubs chowing down on a crocodile. The cubs were born in 2023, with tourists spotting Riddhi with them in June of that year. In anannouncementof the cubs’ arrival, the national park mentioned a “danger of crocodile” in the area prompting increased monitoring in the area as a precautionary measure – perhaps the crocodiles were the ones in need of protection!  ⓘIFLScience is not responsible for content shared from external sites. The park wasdeclareda Project Tiger reserve in 1973, and became a national park in 1980. Riddhi is descended from tigress T-16, aka Machali, who is also known for a tussle with a crocodile that earned her the nickname “crocodile killer”. Riddhi is also no stranger to clashes with her own species, oftenfightingwith her mother Arrowhead and sister Siddhi over territory. One encounter with Siddhi in2021left Riddhi in need of stitches on her tongue. There were plans to relocate Riddhi to Sariska Tiger Reserve due to these bloody family rows, with Riddhi reportedly also killing a cub. However, that decision sparkedoppositionfrom those who said the Sariska and Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserves weren’t equipped for tigers. Tiger T-75 made this same move in 2018, but then died of heat stroke a few months later. Riddhi’s relocation was cancelled when she shacked up with a male tiger T-120, with theTimes of Indiareporting an official of the park saying, “The male tiger was sighted in the area and there are possibilities that T-124 have mated. In such scenario shifting the tigress is not a good idea.” “Since long, no fighting has been witnessed and this has made forest department to reconsider the decision. There was a protest too from the tourism industry stakeholders for shifting a tigress from a main tourism zone of Ranthambore.”",369
Science/Education,Exceptional Fossils Spill The Secrets Of âEnigmaticâ 10-Meter Sharks Found In Mexico,https://www.iflscience.com/exceptional-fossils-spill-the-secrets-of-enigmatic-10-meter-sharks-found-in-mexico-73943,"Exquisitely preserved fossils belonging to an extinct group of giant sharks have been discovered in Mexico, and may help solve some centuries-old mysteries surrounding what these enigmas looked like, what they hunted, and how they fit into the shark evolutionary tree. Ptychodusis a genus of extinctsharksfrom the Albian–Campanian stage of the Cretaceous period (around 105 to 75 million years ago). It contains at least 16 species, which have an estimated gigantic body size of up to 10 meters (33 feet) and have been found on all continents except Antarctica. First reported in 1729, the genus is still to this day one of the most perplexing fossilelasmobranchs– a group of fish that includes sharks, skates, and rays. Plenty of weird teeth have been found, but more detailed fossils, featuring cranial and post-cranial skeletal elements, are very rarely discovered and complete specimens had never been reported before now. But that’s all changed with a new study, in which complete articulated specimens from the early Late Cretaceous of Mexico are described, including a preserved body outline, which provide crucial information aboutPtychodusand its mysterious lifestyle. “The new complete skeletons described here help resolve the long-standing enigma ofPtychodus,” the study’s authors write – helping to answer questions we’ve had for almost two centuries about its anatomy, relationships to other species, and predatory behavior. Phylogenetic and ecomorphological analyses confirmed that, as suspected,Ptychoduswas a titan. The researchers propose a maximum body length of 9.7 meters (31.8 feet), with a corresponding jaw length of 1.9 meters (6.2 feet). For reference, the largest living durophagous shark – sharks that eat hard-shelled organisms, such as corals, shelled mollusks, or crabs – is just 2.5 to 3.5 meters (8.2 to 11.5 feet) long. Overall, the researchers conclude thatPtychoduswas “probably the largest durophagous shark that ever existed”. They also demonstrate that the elusive elasmobranch was a fast-swimming predator, belonging to the mackerel shark group (Lamniformes), an order that also includes thegreat white shark. Ptychodusalso “occupied a specialized predatory niche previously unknown in fossil and extant elasmobranchs”, the team explain. The recent discovery in Mexico “challenges the widely held view that [...]Ptychoduswas a group of bottom-dwelling sharks feeding mainly on shelled benthic invertebrates”. Instead of snacking on organisms likeclamsand crustaceans that live at the bottom of the ocean, the study authors think thatPtychoduspreferred hard-shelled prey items such asammonitesand sea turtles. They also have a theory for what might have brought about its extinction during the Campanian – 10 million years before theCretaceous–Paleogene extinction eventthat wiped out around three-quarters of Earth’s species. During this time,Ptychoduswould have been in direct competition with emerging blunt-toothedmosasaursin the clades Globidensini and Prognathodontini. With their crushing teeth, these predators likely targeted the same prey asPtychodus, which may have been driven to extinction as a result.

Science/Education,"The Earthâs Magnetic Field Is At Least 3.7-Billion-Years Old, New Evidence Shows",https://www.iflscience.com/the-earths-magnetic-field-is-at-least-37-billion-years-old-new-evidence-shows-73937,"The oldest clear evidence for the Earth’s magnetic field shows that it had formed well within the first billion years of the planet’s existence. The new finding takes us closer to answering the important question of whether the Earth’s magnetic field dates to its formation and if not, how soon afterward it appeared. Themagnetic fieldthat surrounds Earth, and partially protects us from solar radiation, is thought to have been essential to life’s formation and survival. Although we know giant planets like Jupiter can havemighty magnetic fields, there is much debate about how common they are for rocky planets. If planet-wide magnetic fields are rare or typically weak, it might represent a limitation to the widespread appearance of life, or at least advanced life, in the galaxy. This has made the quest to discover the origins of Earth’s magnetic field a priority for many geologists, but it’s not an easy question to answer. Rocks can maintain evidence of the magnetic field in which they formed, but this can be lost or altered if they get hot enough to reorder iron particles within them. Now, however, clues have been found in some of the planet’s oldest unaltered rocks. The Isua Supracrustal Belt represents some of the first continental crust material to form, and parts of it have survived relatively unaffected by geologic processing ever since. Unfortunately for geologists, it lies in West Greenland, one of the hardest places on the planet for field research. As with many younger iron-rich rocks, banded iron formations in the Isua Belt reveal the direction, and to some extent the strength, of the magnetic field in which they were formed. Magnetite particles line up in the direction of the field like iron filings around a modern bar magnet. Lead author Professor Claire Nichols of the University of Oxford is confident these are original, rather than having been orientated later while cooling from an intense heat event. “Extracting reliable records from rocks this old is extremely challenging, and it was really exciting to see primary magnetic signals begin to emerge when we analyzed these samples in the lab,” Nichols said in an emailed statement to IFLScience. “This is a really important step forward as we try and determine the role of the ancient magnetic field when life on Earth was first emerging.” The age of the Earth’s magnetic field remains under question in part because we don’t fully understand what causes it today. We know it is a product of movements in the molten outer core, whose high iron content turns convection currents into a dynamo, and these currents in turn are produced by the solidification of the inner core. However, there are enough uncertain details that we can’t be confident whether such movements took place before the solid core formed. The rocks Nichols and colleagues studied suggest that they did, since the inner core is almost certainly much younger, probably more recent than multicellular life. The findings have implications for how much heat escaped the Earth’s core early on, which would have driven upwellings in the mantle and contributed to volcanic activity. The northeastern part of the Isua Belt is unusual, perhaps unique, for rocks of this age in that it sits above continental crust thick enough to protect it from the sort of activity that has heated many other counterparts. Nichols and co-authors concluded the segment they studied reached 550°C (980°F) 3.69 billion years ago, during formation, but has not been above 380°C (720°F) since, making the magnetic particle alignment original.
